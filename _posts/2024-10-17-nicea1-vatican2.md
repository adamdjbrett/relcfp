Two councils
------------

Ecumenical ("worldwide") councils are among the most significant events in the history of Christianity. They constitute the highest legislative and judicial gatherings in the life of the Church, often convened during moments of crisis in which the Christian world recognizes the need to unite as one body and to speak as one voice, seeking to resolve controversy, to define doctrine, to judge canonical or pastoral matters, and to discern the path forward in light of contemporary questions and demands.

The Catholic Church acknowledges twenty-one ecumenical councils, from Nicaea I (325) to Vatican II (1962-5). The year 2025 will mark two important anniversaries: 1700 years since the first ecumenical council, honored as such by all Christians, and 60 years since the closing of the most recent ecumenical council in the Catholic tradition. To commemorate these anniversaries, Catholic institutions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and beyond are sponsoring an academic conference which will be hosted at Marquette University.


One conference
--------------

The fruit of a collaboration between Marquette University, Sacred Heart Seminary and School of Theology, Saint Francis de Sales Seminary, the St. Irenaeus Institute for Catholic Thought, and the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, the Legacies Conference will gather Catholics and other Christians from around the world to celebrate and to study these two councils, their consequential legacies, and the conciliar tradition as a whole. The conference will feature plenary talks from bishops and senior scholars, along with academic papers on a variety of topics related to these themes.

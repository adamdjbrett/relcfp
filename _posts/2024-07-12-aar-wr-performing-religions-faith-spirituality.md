Call for Papers List
--------------------

**Asian American Religious Studies**\
Laura Snell, University of California, Santa Barbara, laurasnell@ucsb.edu\
Albert Shannon Toribio, University of California, Santa Barbara, shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu

For the AAR-WR Conference 2025, the Asian American Religious Studies Unit focuses on the overlapping and often mutually constituting categories of religion and performance. Attending to the mixture of creativity, religion, and spirituality in expressive practice, we invite papers from any discipline that address the various manifestations of performativity of Asian American religion, not preferring any particular mode of creative expression and not privileging any particular religious tradition.

Submit your Proposal Form ([Word](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_word__-_20240624.docx) or [PDF](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_pdf__-_20240624.pdf)) to Laura Snell and Albert Shannon Toribio by September 30, 2024.

**Black Religion and Theology**\
Julius Bailey, University of Redlands, julius_bailey@redlands.edu\
Aaron Grizzell, NorCal MLK Foundation, aaron@norcalmlkfoundation.org

The Black Religion and Theology Unit's mission is to further the development of scholarly research and discussion about the black religious experience; encourage the broadening of Black religion as an academic endeavor; and engage in discourse, from the African diasporic perspective, about religious and theological expression. Following along with this year's theme, which focuses on examining the complex intersections of religion, technology, and science, we welcome proposal submissions from two focus areas. The selected panelists can expect 15-20 minutes to present their work and to enable time for questions and audience responses.

Focus Area A: Artificial intelligence and generative technologies are changing the landscape of the modes and definitions of communication, imagination, connectivity, and, arguably, reality. Both religion and theology in African diasporic expressions have much to say on these matters. We welcome papers that delve into the challenges, opportunities, and innovative expressions that are being forged in this space.

Focus Area B: In many ways, the Black religious expression has been the vanguard through which social justice movements have forged new rights under law, and Black religious scholarship has been vital to building a bulwark against theoretical and methodological pushback in the academy regarding the grounding of these movements in the Black experience. We welcome papers that take an innovative look at modes of Black scholarship at the fulcrum of movements for justice, civil and human rights. This includes speculative and afrofuturist thought now at the forefront of many popular cultural expressions.

Submit your Proposal Form ([Word](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_word__-_20240624.docx) or [PDF](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_pdf__-_20240624.pdf)) to Julius Bailey and Aaron Grizzell by September 30, 2024.

**Buddhist Studies**\
Jake Nagasawa, University of California, Santa Barbara, jnagasawa@umail.ucsb.edu\
Alina Pokhrel, University of Virginia, alina.pokhrel@virginia.edu

"Religious Expression Across Buddhist Worlds"

The Buddhist Studies unit warmly invites scholars, practitioners, and artists to present their creative work that explores multifaceted dimensions of Buddhist thought and practice. We welcome interactive presentations, performances, songs, poetry readings with commentaries, and traditional paper presentations that explore Buddhist expressions of devotion, meditative wisdom, ethical cultivation, esoteric realities, or the significance of affective states across traditions and time and place.

-   How have Buddhist peoples and communities articulated and practiced their devotion across different contexts?
-   How are insights from meditative practices cultivated, communicated, or contrasted?
-   What can we learn from the metaphorical and poetic articulations found across Buddhist traditions?
-   How are emotions understood, experienced, and transformed within Buddhist practice?
-   What role do affective states play in Buddhist practice and theory?
-   What does a contextual understanding of ethics and ethical cultivation look like from within different Buddhist traditions?\
We encourage collaborative presentations across disciplines and traditions as well as comparative readings that illuminate aspects of Buddhist thought and practice otherwise exiled from our scholarship. If you have connections with scholars in other departments or at other institutions, please reach out to them to develop robust and innovative proposals!

Submit your Proposal Form ([Word](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_word__-_20240624.docx) or [PDF](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_pdf__-_20240624.pdf)) to Jake Nagasawa and Alina Pokhrel by September 30, 2024.

**Catholic Studies**\
Samantha Kang, University of California, Santa Barbara, samanthakang@ucsb.edu\
Nathan McWeeney, University of Southern California, mcweeney@usc.edu

This year, the Catholic Studies unit invites papers related to the AAR/WR's 2023 conference theme: Performing Religions, Faith, and Spirituality. We welcome papers from various methodological and disciplinary standpoints and are particularly interested in papers addressing the twin notions of Catholicism as performance and performances of Catholicism as demonstrated in art, popular culture, and politics. We also hope to explore the intersection between Catholicism and tourism as it is encountered at popular travel destinations such as the California Missions, Notre Dame, Sagrada Familia or Vatican City.

Submit your Proposal Form ([Word](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_word__-_20240624.docx) or [PDF](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_pdf__-_20240624.pdf)) to Samantha Kang and Nathan McWeeney by September 30, 2024.

**Christianity**\
"Joey" Alan Le, Independent Scholar, joeyalanle@gmail.com

The Christianity Unit seeks proposals that demonstrate the expression and embodiment of the Christian faith and spirituality as a performance in line with the Conference Theme, "Performing Religions, Faith, and Spirituality." We are particularly interested in proposals that explore the aesthetic and ethical dimensions of the Christian religion, and we encourage real-world applications to be at the center of, or included in, the proposals.

Proposals of essays or works of art may include, but are not restricted to:\
- How should Christian truths and values be demonstrated in public life?\
- What is Christianity's call to promote responsibility and justice in today's nations and corporations?\
- How does the Christian faith inspire hope, serving as a wellspring for human creativity and imagination?

**Disabilities Studies**\
Anjeanette LeBoeuf, Saint Louis University, anjeanette.leboeuf@slu.edu\
Elizabeth Staszak, Independent Scholar, elizabeth.staszak@gmail.com

The Disability Studies Unit welcomes papers which engage with the Conference Theme of "Performing Religions, Faith, and Spirituality." Our unit is also looking for papers which grapple with the questions of space, location, body, and perception. Some of the questions we are hoping to see in proposals are below:

-   What does performativity look like? Who decides what is sacred and what isn't? What is a religious or spiritual experience? 
-   What type of body, gender, and ability becomes the template for religious or spiritual participation? What happens to those types which do not fit the mainstream conception? 
-   How can those that live beyond and out of the mainstream -- white, male, nondisabled -- find ways to perform their religion, faith, and spirituality? 
-   In what ways do disabled people interact with religion and spirituality and science and technology?
-   Does disability allow us to envision and participate in religion and spirituality in varying ways? How might disability and technology dovetail with religion? 

Our unit encourages and welcomes proposals that are beyond traditional conference papers that challenge all our understandings of performativity and engagement.

**Goddess Studies**\
Kali (Meera) Tanikella, Graduate Theological Union, mtanikella@ses.gtu.edu

What Makes Us Human in the Time of AI?\
In keeping with the 2025 AAR-WR conference theme of "Performing Religions, Faith, and Spirituality", the Goddess Studies unit aims to delve into the question: What makes us human in the time of AI?\
As we navigate the complexities of artificial intelligence and its impact on our lives, the study of goddess traditions offers a profound framework for understanding human embodiment, epistemic justice, and alternative epistemologies. We invite papers that address these themes through various perspectives, including but not limited to:

1.  Embodiment: How do goddess traditions and practices emphasize the importance of the body in religious experience? What can these traditions teach us about maintaining our humanity in an increasingly digital world?
2.  Epistemic Justice: How do goddess-centered epistemologies challenge dominant paradigms and offer alternative ways of knowing? In what ways can these perspectives contribute to a more just and inclusive understanding of knowledge in the age of AI?
3.  Alternative Epistemologies: How do goddess traditions provide alternative frameworks for understanding reality, spirituality, and the self? How can these frameworks inform our interactions with technology and our vision for the future?

We encourage submissions that utilize contemporary media, performance, and interdisciplinary approaches to explore these questions. Papers may address, but are not limited to, the following topics:

-   The role of ritual and performance in goddess traditions and their relevance to contemporary spiritual practices.
-   Comparative studies of goddess worship and AI ethics.
-   Narratives of embodiment in goddess myths and their implications for human-AI interactions.
-   The intersection of feminist theology and technology.
-   Case studies of goddess traditions that highlight alternative epistemologies and their practical applications in modern contexts.\
We also welcome collaborative and innovative proposals that engage with other units and disciplines. We believe that a multidisciplinary approach will enrich our understanding and foster dynamic discussions.

**Graduate Student Professional Development**\
Kimberly Diaz, University of California, Riverside, kdiaz038@ucr.edu

For many academics, an integral part to their professional portfolio is the Curriculum vitae (CV). Latin for "course of life," conventional standards for the CV only call for the most polished version of an academic's journey. How can the CV be re-imagined in ways that go beyond an aesthetic and into transparency about the complexities of navigating academia? Is such re-imagination possible, especially given that as an industry academia demands efficiency? What alternative spaces, if any, hearten an academic's vulnerability?

The Graduate Student Professional Development Unit invites scholars to submit proposals that (in-)directly relate to the aforementioned topics/questions or propose a new theme.

Submit your Proposal Form ([Word](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_word__-_20240624.docx) or [PDF](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_pdf__-_20240624.pdf)) to Kimberly Diaz by September 30, 2024.

Delores (Lola) Mondragón, UC Santa Barbara, mondragon@ucsb.edu

The Indigenous Religions Unit seeks proposals that demonstrate the varied intersectional approaches that enrich, inform, and sustain Native American and Indigenous religious traditions and ways of knowing within communities that can further inform others of these rich traditions.\
In keeping with this year's theme of performing religions, faith, and spirituality---we welcome different ways of knowing that decolonize the environment and recenters the re-remembering of ceremonies---keeping in mind that we are not to here to be extracted from but that we share for the purposes of our mutual goals including Indigenous sovereignty, environmental dignity, and rematriation around the world.

All forms of knowledge sharing are welcome including songs, performances, and rituals that are mindful of who is being represented and who are the Elders that have been informed beforehand.

This year, the Western Region conference of the American Academy of Religion is heading to Arizona State University, where we will be focusing on religions, faith, and spirituality. The Jewish Studies unit invites papers from any discipline that contributes to contemporary or historical issues around the performance of Judaism and Jewishness -- broadly construed.

We also invite papers that examine the intersections of Judaism and Jewish performance with innovation and technology. We encourage participants to employ both traditional and experimental modalities in conducting and presenting their research.

The Jewish Studies Unit of the AAR-WR welcomes papers responding to any aspects of the above topics and questions, from all disciplines pertaining to the study of Jews and Judaism.

Dorothea Kahena Viale, Cal Poly Pomona, sacreddancer2@gmail.com\
​Candace Kant, candace.kant@gmail.com

The Pagan Studies unit invites papers and/or panels from any discipline that address how Paganism is performed in the 21st century.

**Philosophy of Religion**\
Mitch Hickman, University of California, Santa Barbara, mitchelehickman@ucsb.edu\
Shakir Stephen, University of California, Santa Barbara, shakirstephen@ucsb.edu

We welcome all papers engaging with this year's conference theme -- "Performing Religions, Faith, and Spirituality" -- as well as additional topics of interest in contemporary Philosophy of Religion. Topics of interest might include:

-   How have philosophers conceptualized performance, expression, and spontaneity, especially in terms of faith, spirituality, and religion? What kinds of performances undergird what it means to be "philosophical" or participate in the discipline of Philosophy of Religion?
-   What is the impact of philosophical thinking in the expression of religious life in and through technological innovation? (e.g. online baptism, virtual communion). In what ways do science, technology, and philosophy contribute to what it means to be (or perform being) modern or postmodern?
-   We invite experts of non-Western philosophies to think through differences in "performing religions, faith, and spirituality" across cultural boundaries. Where do differing philosophies create dialogue or disagreement? How do technologies impact these conversations?
-   In acknowledging the diversity of expressions of religion, spirituality, and faith, which areas can benefit from dialogue with trends and concerns in the Philosophy of Religion? What are the horizons of the discipline? What are some novel applications?
-   We also welcome proposals that investigate particular or individual philosophers, religious thinkers, theologians, or prominent social or political figures in terms of their insights, reflections, or ideas that contribute to the study of religion, or topics within the field of philosophy of religion.\
Submit your Proposal Form ([Word](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_word__-_20240624.docx) or [PDF](https://www.aarwr.com/uploads/2/0/4/2/20420409/aar-wr_proposal_form__fillable_pdf__-_20240624.pdf)) to Mitch Hickman and Shakir Stephen by September 30, 2024.

**Psychology, Culture, and Religion**\
Casey Crosbie, Scripps College, caseygcrosbie@gmail.com\
Katherine Kunz, Center for Religion and Cities, katherine@katherinekunz.com

Keeping with the annual theme of "Performing Religions, Faith, and Spirituality," the Psychology, Culture, and Religion Unit invites papers that explore how religion is "performed" and how these performances affect the interior and social worlds of believers and the larger society.

-   How do you differentiate between "frontstage" (public behavior) and "backstage" (private behavior) in a religious context? Does one support or undergird the other, or is one more indicative of "true" religious observance? Or is religion all just a performance?
-   How does religious ritual, with its repeated acts, gestures, and behaviors, serve to construct and maintain cultural norms? How does this, in turn, influence theology and religious belief?
-   What does it mean to create a "subversive" performance? What examples do we have of marginalized or oppressed communities creating dissenting or innovative religious rituals? What role do these performances play in the evolution of religious practices and beliefs as well as how these communities assert their identity and agency?
-   How do religious performances intersect with other forms of cultural resistance (e.g., art, music, literature)? What role do performances and innovation play in the diversity of religious expression, especially novel religious practices?
-   How has the intersection between science, technology, psychology, and religion evolved? What role does the rapid evolution of AI and other technologies play in religious practice and belief?
-   How has religious performativity changed in the 21st Century, and how has that changed the way we conceive of religion?\
We encourage interdisciplinary approaches and welcome contributions from a range of disciplines: religious studies, psychology, pastoral counseling, sociology, cultural studies, and related fields.

Religion, science, and technology have overlapped with each other for centuries, with each element a crucial component of humanity's existence. Of course, unprecedented advances in technology and scientific discovery in the last two centuries have had far reaching implications for how humanity thinks about, interacts with, and performs its religions. But while the rate of change has increased, these pressure points between religion, science, and technology are not new; the printing press, the Copernican Revolution, and even the invention of the codex all changed how humans have experienced and understood the metaphysical. Of course, the reverse is true as well: religions have often influenced how humans use or think about technology and science.

In this session, we invite papers that study the pressure points of how science, religion, and technology impinge on each other's praxis. How has technology changed how people worship? How have religious convictions altered or restrained how people use technology? How have people begun to treat science like a religion, or their religion like a science? The possible lines of inquiry are as numerous as the ways that humans navigate between their tools, their understanding of the natural world, and their attempts to reach beyond their physical senses.

In line with AAR/WR's 2025 Conference Theme, *Performing Religion, Faith, and Spirituality*, the Religion and the Arts unit this year explores performance and the arts, as well as religion and artistic expression more broadly. In light of the devastating situation this year in the Middle East, and in particular with the staggering loss of life that continues to increase in Palestine, as well as the issues of violent conflict, mass killing, and genocide in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, we are especially interested in how art interacts with religion and genocide, religion and war, and religion and trauma, both in the present time and also historically across cultures, religions and peoples. Performance art related to representation of these events or to cultural healing and survival are encouraged.

We are also always open to coverage of topics on art and religion that are unrelated to this year's unit CFP or to the general conference theme. We encourage the submission of papers that utilize interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and nontraditional approaches to research, as well as a traditional format for paper delivery.

The Religions of Asia Unit invite scholars to explore how performance, in its broadest sense, shapes and is shaped by religious, spiritual, and faith practices within the diverse traditions of Asia. We particularly seek contributions that address the dynamic and performative aspects of religious practices and their impact on individual and community life.\
Topics may address, but not limited to:

-   Rituals and performances in religious practices
-   The role of art, music, and dance in religious expression
-   Pilgrimage and religious festivals
-   The performative aspect of sacred texts and storytelling
-   Religious and spiritual practices in daily life
-   Gender, identity, and performance in religious contexts
-   Interactions between traditional and contemporary forms of religious expression
-   The impact of globalization and transnationalism on religious performances
-   Religion and performance in digital and media landscapes

Submissions that engage with the broader conference theme are particularly encouraged. However, those are also welcome that connect with religions of Asia, even if they do not immediately interface with the conference theme.

We welcome interdisciplinary approaches and encourage scholars from various fields, including religious studies, anthropology, sociology, history, and the arts, to submit their proposals.

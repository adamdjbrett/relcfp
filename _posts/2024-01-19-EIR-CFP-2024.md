## CALL FOR PAPERS

Sea Change: Religion, Cosmology, Environment

2024 Eastern International Regional Meeting of the American Academy of Religion

May 2-4, 2024 | University of Toronto

Deadline for submissions is February 5, 2024

The [Eastern International Region](https://eiraar.org/) of the AAR invites you to submit proposals for the 2024 Regional Meeting. This meeting will be held at the University of Toronto, which is [located](https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/Toronto) on the traditional territories of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. The theme for the 2024 Conference is Sea Change: Religion, Cosmology, Environment. Understanding that we all live within a time of climate crisis, we welcome papers and panels that broadly engage the theme across regions, traditions, historical periods, theories, and methods.

Some possible prompts include: how have religious genres and modes of understanding the world -- such as apocalypticism, nihilism, and balance---shaped responses to what is possible in the face of natural disasters or human-caused threats to existence? What are ways that religious traditions writ large have understood the shaping forces of the natural world, and the interrelated roles of human and non-human animals? How have practices of and justifications for resource extraction been shaped by religious cosmologies, in the past and present? What does the study of visual, sensory, or material culture bring to our understanding of religion, cosmology, and environment? Is the Anthropocene a scientific and/or religious periodization, a call to action, or something else altogether?

Proposals that do not relate to the 2024 conference theme are also warmly welcome.

AAR membership is not required to submit a proposal. Scholars from any region or association may apply to present. We are especially excited to host members from the newly-created AAR [Northeast region](https://www.aar-ne.org/). Only proposals received by the deadline will be considered for inclusion in the program. Undergraduate-only panels are encouraged -- please see instructions below.

For 20 years, the [Presbyterian Historical Society's Research Fellowship Program](https://pcusa.org/historical-society/services/resources-opportunities/research-fellowship-program?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) has awarded annual research and travel grants to eligible scholars, students, and independent researchers in a broad range of fields including mission history, social justice movements, and ecumenism. The program awards research and travel grants of $2,500, which can be used to cover travel, lodging, and other research expenses. Consideration is given to those whose primary residence is more than 75 miles from Philadelphia. Fellows submit reports to PHS and are encouraged to publish their work in the *[Journal of Presbyterian History](https://www.jstor.org/journal/jpreshist?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)*. PHS is currently accepting applications for 2025 Research Fellowships. The deadline has been extended to March 3, 2025.

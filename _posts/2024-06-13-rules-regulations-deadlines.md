The 2025 IAHR World Congress welcomes the following presentation formats:

-   **[Open panels](https://iahr2025.org/call-for-panels-papers/rules-and-regulations/#openpanels) **with **[Individual Submissions](https://iahr2025.org/call-for-panels-papers/rules-and-regulations/#individualsub)**

-   **[Roundtables](https://iahr2025.org/call-for-panels-papers/rules-and-regulations/#roundtables)**

All individual papers and suggestions for open and closed panels and roundtables are subject to [review](https://iahr2025.org/call-for-panels-papers/rules-and-regulations/#reviews) before acceptance. You can read more about the review process below.

Each participant can give only ONE individual paper.

Each participant can convene only ONE panel -- open or closed. There is no restriction on the number of *closed *panels in which a participant can serve as a respondent or discussant.

### **Open Panels**

Open panels are convened by one or more participants who *openly *invite scholars interested in a particular topic to present a paper. The announcement of an open panel acts as a call for papers. The conveners of the open panel decide which papers, **previously accepted by the Congress committee,** are included in the panel. Papers not accepted in panel will still be included in the Congress and will be treated as individual submissions (see below).

Each open panel comprises a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 papers. Presenters of each paper are allowed 15--20 minutes (depending on the number of participants) for their presentation. The duration of a panel is 90 minutes. Open panels which receive a large number of submissions are permitted to organize a maximum of 5 panel sessions, each with a maximum of 4 papers.

Topics of open panels must be consistent with the scientific theme of the congress, ["OUT OF EUROPE: Studying Religion(s) in Interconnected Worlds" and fit one of its subthemes](https://iahr2025.org/general-information/call-for-panels-papers/), i.e.:

-   MAPPING the unity and diversity of the discipline: past, present, and future 
-   UNDERSTANDING the concept of "religion": uses and contexts
-   CONNECTING the particular and the universal
-   CROSSING the boundaries: approaches and methodologies
-   ENGAGING scholarship and knowledge exchange
-   RELATING religion with culture and society

Proposals for open panel topics must include a panel title (no more than 20 words) and a panel description of 200 to 250 words. The description must highlight the significance of the topic for the Congress, provide the key methodological or conceptual ideas of the panel, and detail how they relate to the Congress' main theme and to the selected subtheme.

Deadlines:

-   Submissions open: 15th October 2023, rolling admission
-   Submissions close: 28th January 2024
-   Notifications of acceptance: notification within three months; 14th February 2024, at the latest

Please check the list of accepted open panels [here.](https://iahr2025.org/open-panels/)

### **Closed Panels**

Closed panels are convened by one or more participants and include, from the beginning, the complete list of scholars presenting papers in the panel.

Closed panels must be consistent with the scientific theme of the Congress and in line with one of its subthemes. The closed panels consist of a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 panelists presenting a paper, with a panel convener as the chair. Further responders or discussants are allowed. The duration of a panel is 90 minutes. The conveners of the panel must contact panelists and prepare **a single proposal** for the entire panel.

The panel conveners must submit a title of no more than 20 words and description of the panel of  200 to 250 words; the complete list of participants, including the panel chair and all presenters and discussants (if any). The panel conveners are tasked with collecting and submitting the abstracts for all papers in the panel as part of their single proposal. The paper abstracts, of 200 to 250, must include the title of the paper (of no more than 20 words), the name of the presenter, his/her academic affiliation, and 3--6 keywords. When submitting a proposal, authors should assign it to one of the [six thematic streams](https://iahr2025.org/call-for-panels-papers#streams).

Deadlines:

-   Submissions open: 1st March 2024, rolling admission
-   Submissions close: 1st December 2024
-   Notification of acceptance: notification within three months; 5th January 2025, at the latest

### **Individual Papers**

Scholars are welcome to submit individual papers. They must be consistent with the scientific theme of the congress and fit one of its subthemes. Each presenter is allowed 15 minutes for their presentation.

Proposals for individual papers should include the name of the presenter, their academic affiliation, the title of their paper (of no more than 20 words), an abstract of 200 to 250 words, and 3--6 keywords. When submitting a proposal, authors should assign their paper either to one of the fifty-one [open panels](https://iahr2025.org/call-for-panels-papers/open-panels/) and one of the [six thematic streams](https://iahr2025.org/call-for-panels-papers#streams).

### **Roundtables**

Roundtables are pre-arranged sessions in which a group of up to 5 scholars discusses topics of general academic interest consistent with the scientific theme of the Congress and in line with its subthemes. The duration of a roundtable is 90 minutes. It may contain short, 5--10 minute presentations, but the general goal must be to spark a vibrant discussion among the panelists and with the audience.

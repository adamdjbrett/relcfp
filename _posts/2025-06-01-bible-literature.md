Bible and Literature (Panel / In-Person) *Presiding Officer: Kathryn Vulic (Western Washington University)*

This session welcomes papers about the Bible and Literature that will ideally but not necessarily connect to the conference theme of "Palimpsests: Memory and Oblivion," and touch on:

- Jewish biblical or post-biblical works

- Canonical or non-canonical Christian scriptures

- Post-biblical literary works that borrow from, adapt, translate, comment on, satirize, or allude to biblical stories, verses, characters, themes, or tropes

We are particularly interested in papers that explore how biblical texts hide (or are evident) palimpsestically behind post-biblical, apocryphal, Talmudic texts, and later literary works, including those that are religious, spiritual, or seemingly secular in nature. We are also open to papers that explore shifting hermeneutic practices or interpretations of particular biblical narratives, changing, shifting, or surprising uses of and adaptations of biblical characters and tropes, works that explore issues of religious syncretism, and spiritual or religious issues or debates broadly considered.

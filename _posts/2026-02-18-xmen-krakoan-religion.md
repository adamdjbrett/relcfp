Beginning with Jonathan Hickman's House of X/Powers of X limited series, the Krakoan Age X-Men stories occur against the backdrop of the establishment of a post-scarcity and post-mortality mutant homeland on the living island of Krakoa. The Krakoan Age ran from 2019 and 2024 and included more than 500 issues spread across 80 different comic titles. Within this vast body of text, a dizzying plurality of story-types are explored, ranging from gritty police procedurals, to sprawling war stories, to cozy slice-of-life tales. The Krakoan Age stories are also notable in their creative and interesting engagement with religious stories and themes, particularly in series such as Way of X, Legion of X and The Onslaught Revelation.

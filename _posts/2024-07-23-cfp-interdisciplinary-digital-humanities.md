## Interdisciplinary Research, Digital Humanities, Text Analysis (56th Annual Convention of the Northeast Modern Language Association (March 6-9, Philadelphia, PA). )
### Philadelphia, PA
### Organization: Northeast Modern Language Association


## Description
Humanities driven scholarship invites writing on literature, education, architecture, geopolitics, gender studies, sociology, anthropology, history, economics and narrative medicine. The main goal of this session is writing in response to a series of challenging, exciting non-fiction and multicultural short stories and novels. Though a great deal of our attention will be on the novels as works of literature, we will also incorporate ideas from numerous subjects that are not specifically literary, including sociology, anthropology, history, and economics. As an introduction to debates on fiction works, we may help you prepare to write wherever you go; strong writing skills will help you professionally to serve as a leader in the Humanities.

Topics include Multiculturalism Gibran, Rumi, Adichie, O'Conner, Achebe, Hurston, Archetypes, The Hero Journey, argument about a theme based on critical reading and discussions, digital humanities resources and interdisciplinary studies. Example of a research based MLA style essay is based on analysis of No One Is Coming to Save Us, a revelatory debut from an insightful voice; with echoes of The Great Gatsby it is an arresting and powerful novel about an extended African American family and their colliding visions of the American Dream. In evocative prose, Stephanie Powell Watts has crafted a full and stunning portrait that combines a universally resonant story with an intimate glimpse into the hearts of one family.

An advocacy project is a two part assignment with two activities: The first part includes a coffeehouse presentation of a YouTube video of interest, art related website, or other idea such as a Ted Talk. Critical reading based on digital resources such as additional web study of blogs will aid studies.

Humanities driven scholarship invites writing on literature, education, architecture, geopolitics, gender studies, sociology, anthropology, history, economics and narrative medicine. In 2004, results of Maryann P. DiEdwardo's case study research suggested that the integration of music in the college classroom improved students' grades and abilities to compose thesis statements for research papers in courses that emphasize reading and writing skills. In her initial study, Dr. DiEdwardo refined Howard Gardner's 1993 definition of music as a separate intellectual competence.

Film Credit (Author of memoir titled The Legacy of Katharine Hepburn; interviewed by Bertrand Tessier for documentary). The French director Bertrand Tessier creates a series of 52 minutes documentaries about mythical couples in Hollywood for French television OCS, a channel dedicated to Hollywood movies. One of the documentaries is about Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn. My book on Katherine Hepburn is a reference. I also have a film credit for my interview with Bertrand about my book, The Legacy of Katharine Hepburn: Fine Art as a Way of Life. It was written in 2004. Her purpose was to revisit an old thesis, the potential historiography of Katharine Hepburn, for educational purposes. She updated the research to include the possibility of a new historiography based on the growing legacy of the famous Katharine Hepburn. Maryann DiEdwardo suggests that: "... the legacy has just begun to change our cultural views of women and education. I produce activities and goals for educators and families to use the legacy of this special actress for improvement of lives" (DiEdwardo, Maryann Pasda, page 79). Her book was published in 2005 and recounts her studies from 1978 to 2005.

Review: "Dr. DiEdwardo's book is a 'must have' for all educators, especially for those who teach students of other languages. The book is simple, and its components are easy to follow. What I find particularly compelling about this book is the idea to use authors from the students' home country to enhance self-esteem and pride, in addition to creating individual voices.

- 'Hermeneutics, Metacognition, and Writing' investigates the social functionality of actions as an essential criterion of study. It focuses on hermeneutics: interpretation through the lens of philosophy of metacognition.

- Vital contributions to the book include several chapters by Dr. Maryann P. DiEdwardo herself, which explore various facets of the central topic, including the intersectionality of hermeneutics, metacognition, and semiotics, as well as social movements.

This collection of critiques and case studies examines the imagined cultural landscape of specific works and associated activities such as fine art, music, poetry, and digital humanities, which aim to initiate self-monitoring as metacognition, or meta-reflection, by creating interior interpersonal space to overcome adversity. This edited volume will be of particular interest to scholars and students of textual hermeneutics as it relates to prose writing and artistic works in non-verbal media.

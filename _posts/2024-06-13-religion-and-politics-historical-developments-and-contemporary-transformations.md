Special Issue Information
-------------------------
  
Dear Colleagues,
  
The relationship between religion and politics is both dynamic and complex. Scholars have revealed ways in which individual religious beliefs and practices influence political attitudes, as well as how political movements shape the actions of religious people and institutions. In short, religion and politics often have a reciprocal relationship. Moreover, this relationship has important implications for individual liberty, civic engagement, global conflict, and human rights.
  
A few contemporary examples of this dynamic relationship include research on American politics that has suggested citizens will sometimes adapt their religious identities and even religious affiliation because of their partisan commitments; how politicians in Brazil must negotiate how to campaign between two major religious movements, Catholicism and Evangelicalism (and especially Pentecostalism); how, in Turkey, laïcité (secularism) is a constitutional provision, but Islam is incorporated in the public-school curriculum; the growth of Hindu nationalism in India, which has had domestic effects but has also generated tensions in international relations; and how a swath of coups in Africa have raised concerns about religious violence and violations of religious freedom.
  
These developments are by no means limited to modern politics. Questions about religious establishments, empire, religious violence, and conscientious objection define humanity's politics and philosophic advances throughout all of documented human history. Figures no less than Aristotle, al-Farabi, Jesus, Confucius, Gandhi, Marx, and more have articulated normative and positive theories about politics and religion.
  
This Special Issue, "Religion and Politics: Historical Developments and Contemporary Transformations," thus seeks to explore the intricacies of this reciprocal relationship through various research methods, including (but not limited to) historical or legal analysis, political theory, theological exegesis, ethnography and case studies, experiments, and large-N quantitative methods. Articles may focus on a single or multiple geographic areas, comparative theories, or global phenomena, and contributions of high-quality scholarship from any academic discipline related to the focus of the Special Issue are welcome. In assessing this relationship over time and through several different approaches, we hope to further advance the scholarly understanding of how religion affects politics and how politics affects religion.
  
Possible themes of interest may include, as follows:
  
-   Secularization and the growth or decline of religious institutions;
-   Changing or overlapping (non-)religious identities;
-   Commitments to civil or public religion;
-   The global rise in religious nationalism and fundamentalism;
-   Religion and interstate conflict or peacebuilding;
-   Attitudes and behaviors related to "culture wars" issues;
-   Colonialism and religious syncretism;
-   Religious liberty issues and the COVID-19 pandemic;
-   Challenges of defining religion in practice;
-   Historical developments in policies regarding religion;
-   Experimental manipulations of religious rhetoric;
-   Religion, migration, and international relations;
-   Multiculturalism and religious tolerance;
-   New religious movements and challenges of governance;
-   Religion and transnational environmental ethics.
  
We request that, prior to submitting a manuscript, interested authors submit a proposed title and an abstract of 200--300 words summarizing their intended contribution.

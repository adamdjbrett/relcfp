Special Issue Information
-------------------------

Dear Colleagues,

This Special Issue aims to evaluate religious media as examples of situated cognition, as it is broadly understood. Case studies may include a diverse range of sacred texts, music, architecture, and ritual practices. Historical instances of religious media are welcome, as well as recent digital developments in virtual reality and artificial intelligence. The issue will approach each case as an example of situated cognition. For instance, essays might focus on novel interpretations of the extended nature of religious communication practices, enacted musical or artistic performances, embodied ritual practices, or various aspects of socially extended religious cognition. The issue also invites essays that recognize methodological innovation arising from such analyses. Approaching religious media as examples of situated cognition may foster new synergies with pragmatist, hermeneutic, phenomenological, and deconstructive approaches to the study of religion.

In this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome. Research areas may include (but are not limited to) the following:

-   Situated cognition;
-   Extended mind theory;
-   4e cognition;
-   Phenomenology of religion;
-   Media studies;
-   Pragmatist studies of religion;
-   Hermeneutics;
-   Deconstruction;

I look forward to receiving your contributions.

Dr. Timothy Stanley\
*Guest Editor*

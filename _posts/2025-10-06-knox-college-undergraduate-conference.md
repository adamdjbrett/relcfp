The Religious Studies program at Knox College and the Knight Fund for Religion and Culture are planning our second annual Undergraduate Religious Studies Conference. 

This event will be open to any undergraduate student presenting original research or creative work related to the connections between religion and identity. The conference will be free to attend, and breakfast and lunch on Saturday, October 25 will be provided.

The theme of this year's Undergraduate Religious Studies Conference is "Religions In/and/Out/of Time."

Religion is a social, cultural and historical phenomenon and is thus bound to time: the past, the present, and the future. The study of religion is grounded in historical work, social scientific inquiry, creative work, and speculation about the future. The question of how religion exists within time and also transcends the boundaries of historical time extends beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. This conference invites presentations that examine religion as the product of particular time(s), as informing our understanding of the present, or as existing outside the confines of history in the unknown future. We also welcome papers that use religion to interrogate human experiences of or assumptions about time (e.g., the divine might be considered to be outside of time as we understand it).

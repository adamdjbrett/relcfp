### CALL FOR PAPERS:

The Department of Religious Studies' Graduate Student Association at Northwestern University invites submissions for a graduate student conference centered on the theme "Desire and Intimacy in the Study of Religion," to be held in Evanston, Illinois on October 25-27, 2024. We request submission materials by May 1, 2024.

This conference will explore how desire and intimacy shape religious lives and the scholars who study them. Desire and intimacy is everywhere---in the intimacy of a child as she holds a statue, or in a mosque where two men kiss, or in a church as a Palestinian minister speaks of his desire for peace---yet this theme has rarely been foregrounded in Religious Studies. This conference is oriented around a set of questions. First, attuned to bodily intimacies, including intimacies forged between humans as well as humans and their gods, saints, and spirits, we ask: How do touch, glances, and words create intimacies and desires between religious subjects? How do religious institutions, texts, and families foreclose certain forms of desire, especially that of marginalized people? And how do intimacy and desire exist as sites of possibility and violence in the study of religion? Second, this conference is invested in the realm of the political. How do religious subjects navigate and fight for their political desires? How are politico-religious desires forged within such locations as poetry, literature, law, activism, and art? Finally, this conference attends to our own desires as scholars of religion. How do desire and intimacy shape our own experiences as scholars? What happens when scholarly desire comes up against realities of fieldwork or the archive? What happens when we feel we have become too close to a text or group of people? Our conference will address these pressing questions. 

Paper topics for this conference include, but are not limited to:

    -   Philosophical intimacies in Tibetan Buddhist tantras
    -   Queer and trans Muslim desires in Indonesia
    -   Political and religious freedoms in Palestine
    -   State/religious violence and attacks on reproductive justice
    -   Desire and its foreclosures for Rohingya in Myanmar
    -   Black feminist thought, meditation, and the bodily intimacy of healing
    -   Desire and the body in Tibetan women's poetry
    -   Auto-ethnographic accounts of desire and intimacy in religion
    -   Desires and intimacies of ghosts and spirits in the study of religion
    -   Racial justice, Black religion, and desires for embodied freedom
    -   Land, sovereignty, and desire in Indigenous religions
    -   Objects, materiality, and the intimacy of religious paraphernalia
    -   Intimacies and desires of objects implicated in and orienting religious worlds (new materialisms and ontologies)
    -   The violent desires of nation-states in the study of religion
    -   #MeToo and desires for justice in religious communities
    -   Film, art, and sound in forging and documenting intimate religious experiences

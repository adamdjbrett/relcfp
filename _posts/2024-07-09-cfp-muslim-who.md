CFP for an Edited Volume: Muslim Who? (Re)Making Gendered Identities

Editors: Iqra Shagufta Cheema and Sabah Firoz Uddin

Submission Deadline Extended to June 30, 2024

**Project Description:**

In this edited volume, we invite scholarly essays that examine the relationship between gender and Muslim identities as it is (re)presented in political spaces, visual cultures, and sociopolitical discourses. Some of the questions this volume seeks to examine are:

-   How is the idea of gender mobilized to in/de/form Muslim identities, both within and outside Muslim communities?

-   In what ways do Muslims contest, resist, and negotiate their gendered identities in relation with the proscribed notions of Muslimness?

-   How do conversations about gender and its performance influence and/or are influenced by the dominant religious and cultural discourses, both in the Global North and the Global South?

Political spaces and cultural conversations are rife with anti-Muslim sentiments as well as negotiation of Muslim identity itself (Abdul Khabeer 2016, Shehabuddin 2021). Muslim women and non-binary individuals are particularly subject to these identitarian interrogations of who is a Muslim. However, rather than retreating from these spaces and conversations, they are increasingly engaging in acts of resistance that, in turn, trigger gendered and racialized reactions (Bouclin 2013, Ali 2022, Islam 2023). This volume brings together scholars who center gender in their analysis of Muslim-led counterpublics to illuminate how Muslims are negotiating religious, cultural and ideological (re)presentations of gender in public and private spaces (Asen 2000). Overall, this volume examines the role of gender -- as it functions and is understood within and outside of Muslim communities -- in the negotiation of Muslim identities in the global context.

We particularly invite contributions from minority Muslim sects, identities, and communities. Please email your 250 word long abstracts and a short bio to <gender.muslim@gmail.com>.

The current development of ecology has unveiled new challenges for contemporary philosophical reflection. In this regard, it is no longer feasible to interpret human nature through a reflection on the human person as an isolated being from his environment. The paradigm of human ecology presented here aims to inherit the reflection on the philosophy of nature (including the philosophy of human nature), proposing the current ecological issue as an eminently anthropological theme: the place of the human being in the cosmos also indicates his/her essence. This task compels us to reconsider the specificity of the human being in relation to the world through the theme of dwelling, inviting us to reflect on the activities of stewardship and building the common home. Thus, it becomes possible to reframe the current ecological issue as a predominantly anthropological crisis: to heal the ecosystem's wound, we must first mend the fracture within the human person.

Naturaleza y Libertad invites submissions for its forthcoming issue exploring "The Future of Human Ecology." We seek contributions that delve into the philosophical, anthropological, and ecological dimensions of human-nature relationships, addressing questions such as:

-   Reimagining human-nature interactions in the context of ecological crises
-   The philosophical implications of human dwelling and stewardship
-   Ethical considerations in ecological restoration and conservation efforts
-   Technological innovations and their impact on human ecology
-   Cultural perspectives on the human-nature relationship
-   Psychological dimensions of ecological consciousness
-   Integral ecology and human ecology
-   The philosophical foundation of human ecology

## **CALL FOR PAPERS**

The Australian Association for the Study of Religion (AASR) annual conference will be held **November 29 & 30 2024** in Canberra, co-hosted by the Centre for Religion, Ethics, and Society (CRES), St Mark's National Theological Centre, and United Theological College, at Charles Sturt University's Canberra Campus.

This conference will consider the theme "**Thinking Religion in Place**." We welcome proposals on any topic pertaining to the study of religion, but we are particularly interested in papers that reflect on the significance of place (including the scholar's own location) to the study of religion. In connection with the relaunch of the *Journal for the Academic Study of Religion*, we invite scholars to reﬂect critically both on their place on larger maps, and also on the impact of local and international forces on the phenomena that interest them.
*All**presenters will be required to be members of the AASR by 25 November 2024****.**** Members of the New Zealand Association for the Study of Religion are exempt from this requirement. Concession fees for the conference and membership registration are available.

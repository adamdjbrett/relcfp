Dear Colleagues,

We are inviting submissions for a Special Issue of *Religions* on **Race, Religion, and Nationalism**.

Four years ago, on March 15, 2019, a gunman stormed into Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing fifty-one people and seriously injuring forty others. The perpetrator was a "white European ethno-nationalist" who was motivated by far-right, radical perceptions of Muslims as "invaders"[^1].  A report released by the International Commission to Combat Religious Racism earlier this year documented at least fifty-eight attacks on places of worship in North America in the last twenty years that were motivated by similar racist and/or nationalist sentiments[^2]. These are just a few examples of the role of racism and nationalism in violence against religious communities in recent years.

This Special Issue invites submissions that interrogate the intersection between race, religion, and nationalism in the 21st century. Submissions might explore questions such as: What role does religion play in nationalist groups and movements? How do racism and racialization play a role in discrimination and violence against religious communities?

We welcome submissions on any geographic area and religious community; however, we are especially interested in work on white Christian nationalism and/or discrimination against Africana or indigenous religions. We also especially encourage submissions that utilize new digital resources on race, religion and/or Christian nationalism such as:

-   The International Commission to Combat Religious Racism's reports on religious racism in Brazil (2022) and in North America (2023)[^3]
-   The Department of Religious Studies at the University of Alabama and the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History's "Uncivil Religion" project on the role of religion in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol Attack[^4]
-   The Public Religion Research Institute's survey on white Christian nationalism[^5]

Articles in this Special Issue might build upon recent literature regarding the concept of "religious racism" and its manifestations in Brazil and elsewhere, the racialization of Muslims in the U.S. and Europe, and racial and religious biases in the conceptualization of "terrorism" and "extremism", among others.

We request that, prior to submitting a manuscript, interested authors initially submit a proposed title and an abstract of 400--600 words summarizing their intended contribution. Please send it to Dr. Danielle Boaz at dboaz@charlotte.edu. Abstracts will be reviewed by the guest editors to ensure proper fit within the scope of the Special Issue. Full manuscripts will undergo double-blind peer review.

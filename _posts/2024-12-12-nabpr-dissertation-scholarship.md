The NABPR is committed to encouraging academically qualified scholars and teachers of religion who carry out their teaching and research with a sense of Baptist identity.  To that end, the NABPR dissertation scholarship supports emerging scholars in their academic journeys and supports new research, especially research that impacts the Baptist tradition.

One scholarship of $3,000 will be awarded each year.  In addition, recipients can receive two separate travel stipends in the amount of $1,000 to attend the May meeting and/or $1,000 to attend the November AAR/SBL meeting of the NABPR, where their work will be recognized by the association.

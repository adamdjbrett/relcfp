## CALL FOR PAPERS: Asian American Religious Studies Unit

AMERICAN ACADEMY OF RELIGION WESTERN REGION (AAR/WR) 2024 ANNUAL CONFERENCE In-Person Conference at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV)\
March 15-17, 2024

The Asian American Religious Studies Unit invites papers for the American Academy of Religion Western Region Annual Meeting 2024.Focusing on the definition and redefinition of religious/secular, the unit wishes to explore how these categories are shifted and created through media and politics across boundaries geographical and otherwise. How are Asian American religions affected by movement in these categories? How has transnationalism shaped debates around what is and is not religion? How has it shaped the lived experience of Asian American communities? This year we seek papers concerned with the following themes:

- Transnationalism
- Materiality
- Space/Place
- Categories of Religion and the Secular
- New Religious Movements
- Media and Religion

The deadline for abstract submission to AAR/WR is November 15, 2023. Scholars of all levels are invited to participate in this dialogue. Please send your abstracts (250 words) to Shannon Toribio (shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu).

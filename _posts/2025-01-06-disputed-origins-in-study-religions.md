The Religious Studies Graduate Society of McGill University's School of Religious Studies invites you to submit your paper proposal to our 2025 bilingual conference: **(Disputed) Origins in the Study of Religions**

From the beginnings narrated in religious texts, to the founding figures of religious traditions or philosophical schools, fi·om the origins of subfields to the tracing out of their respective academic boundaries, to claims of grounds in philosophy of religion, there is no sense in which the polysemous notion of 'origin' is not central to the study of religion. An origin is both a  creative act of spontaneity and a determining fi·arne with a special, even normative, claim on everything that follows from it. Therefore, origins are and have been unique sites of dispute and contestation. Origins are thus subject to claims, counter-narratives, reformulations, and endings
followed in tu1n by new beginnings. We seek submissions that treat the theme of 'origin' in all senses and meanings relevant to the field of religious studies, as broadly conceived as possible.

We invite participants to submit papers that reflect their research by situating their work within the context of origin, genesis, and disputed origins: When vve consider how religion is understood, practiced, talked about, and studied, inside and outside of academia, what exactly are origins? How and by whom are they defined and narrated? How and why are they sites of ongoing disputes? Proposals that do not relate directly to these themes are also welcomed. We hope this bilingual conference will be a space where, together, graduate students from different universities gather in Tiohtia:ke (Montreal) and will find a place to shru·e their expertise with each other and build a lasting sense of academic community.

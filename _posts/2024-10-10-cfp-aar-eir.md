CALL FOR PAPERS

Annual Conference of the American Academy of Religion Eastern International Region

April 4-6, 2025 | St. Lawrence University, Canton, NY

Deadline for submissions is December 16, 2024

Proposals can be submitted via this form: [](https://forms.gle/vxUhXtcysjzKA8X76)<https://forms.gle/vxUhXtcysjzKA8X76>. 

The [Eastern International Region](https://eiraar.org/) of the AAR invites you to submit proposals for the 2025 Regional Meeting. This meeting will be held at [St. Lawrence University Hotel](https://staystlawrence.com/) in Canton, NY. We are also thrilled to be hosting this year's conference in collaboration with the [New York Six](https://newyork6.org/) Liberal Arts Consortium. The theme for the 2025 Conference is The Futures of Religious Studies. 

The Humanities in general and Religious Studies in particular face difficult challenges amid the uncertain future of higher education. Nevertheless, the understanding of religion seems crucial to comprehending present conflicts and future developments in our social, economic, and political worlds. We contend that our members are best served by approaching these challenges collaboratively, drawing from multiple perspectives and areas of expertise. We therefore welcome papers and panels that broadly engage the theme across regions, traditions, historical periods, theories, and methods.

Some possible prompts include:

-   What is the future of religion, especially in North America and Europe? How might this future be shaped by shifting demographics and transforming technologies?
-   What is the future of secularism and nonreligion? How are scholars of religion equipped to understand these changes?
-   What is the future of Religious Studies, as a department and a field of research?
-   What does the future hold for Religious Studies graduates, and how might scholars prepare students for these roles?
-   What is the future of religious nationalism, in Canada, the US, and other regions across the globe?
-   How is religion implicated in present global conflicts and how might we imagine the future of religion in conflicts at home and abroad?
-   What methods and theories from *outside* the field might scholars of Religious Studies integrate in their work? How can perspectives and tools from Religious Studies enrich *other* fields or endeavours?

Proposals that do not relate to the 2025 conference theme are also warmly welcomed.

AAR membership is not required to submit a proposal. Scholars from any region or association may apply to present. We are especially excited to host members from the newly-created AAR[ Northeast region](https://www.aar-ne.org/). Only proposals received by the deadline will be considered for inclusion in the program. Undergraduate-only panels are encouraged -- please see instructions below.

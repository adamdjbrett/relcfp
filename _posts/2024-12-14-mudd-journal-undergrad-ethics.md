The Roger Mudd Center for Ethics at Washington and Lee University is pleased to invite undergraduate submissions to the yearly Mudd Undergraduate Journal of Ethics (MUJE), one of the nation's few undergraduate journal productions focused on ethics. MUJE values diverse topics in ethics that engage interdisciplinary content and readership across all academic curricula in the exploration of human well-being and values. This year marks an important development in the life of the journal as it will now be featured exclusively online. 

The Mudd Undergraduate Journal of Ethics accepts general submissions on any topic in ethics, as well as submissions related to the yearly theme. The 2024-25 theme investigates Medical Ethics. Submissions may be academic papers or creative works, including poetry, short stories, and visual art. We are looking for work that demonstrates critical thinking, thoughtfulness, and creativity. 

Submissions will undergo an anonymous peer-reviewed process, and authors whose works are selected will have their content published in a peer-reviewed, undergraduate publication! 

## **Guidelines for Academic Paper Submissions **
- Papers of no more than 3,000 words that make a normative ethical claim, broadly construed. 
- Papers describing a range of ethical topics including legal ethics, environmental ethics, normative theory, historical ethics, technology ethics, and more.
- Papers addressing an aspect of the yearly theme. 
- Format citations in Chicago Style with endnotes. Papers with other formats may be submitted on a contingent basis that they will be altered by the author to Chicago Style upon acceptance.

## **Guidelines for Creative Submissions**

- Written and visual media addressing a range of ethical topics. This creative expression may overtly raise questions or subtly illustrate tensions highlighting ethical concerns, communal values, individual responsibility, and the like.
- Short stories or creative writing pieces: roughly 2,000 - 3,500 words
- Poetry: no more than three poems/author
- Visual art
-  We will accept .jpeg files with a 300 DPI resolution. Your work must be 1100 pixels wide (min.), height flexible. 
-  Please include a brief artist statement of no more than 300 words.
-  If you choose to include a caption for your work, please do not exceed 150 words.

Notification of acceptance to the journal will be made via email in early 2025.

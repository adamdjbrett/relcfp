## **Event information**

The 2025 Eastern Conference of the Society of Christian Philosophers, cosponsored by Princeton Theological Seminary, the Princeton Project in Philosophy & Religion, and the Rutgers Center for the Philosophy of Religion, will take place at Princeton Theological Seminary on October 2--4, 2025. The theme of the conference is "The Philosophical Legacy of Robert Merrihew Adams." All interested in attending are invited to register.

The late Bob Adams (September 8, 1937--April 16, 2024) made seminal contributions to several areas in philosophy, including the history of modern philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, and philosophy of religion. He was a founding member and second president of the Society of Christian Philosophers. Bob Adams was also a longtime member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton Theological Seminary, where he received a degree in 1962. The conference will feature keynote lectures by Keith DeRose (Yale University), Sukjae Lee (Seoul National University), and Marleen Rozemond (University of Toronto). There will also be a plenary panel that will engage with Adams's work and consider its ongoing relevance. Other sessions at the conference may be on any philosophical topic, with some priority given to papers related to the conference theme.

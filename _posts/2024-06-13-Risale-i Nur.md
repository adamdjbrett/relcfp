"The Future of Risale-i Nur Studies in the West"\
An Academic Conference on Said Nursi, His Writings, and His Continuing Legacy\
Date: November 14-16, 2024\
Place: John Carroll University (JCU), 1 John Carroll Boulevard, University Heights, Ohio 44118

Conference Background
---------------------

This interfaith and theological conference is a joint initiative of Said Nursi Chair in Islamic Studies of the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at John Carroll University (JCU) and the Interdisciplinary Journal of Islamic Studies (IJIS) sponsored by Respect Graduate School (RGS).

The Chair is named after the prominent Muslim thinker from Turkey, Bediüzzaman Said Nursi (d. 1960), whose motto, "Our heart is so full of love that there is no space for hatred to enter," lies at the heart of IJIS' vision. IJIS is an international double-blind peer-reviewed English-language journal of Islamic studies and social sciences that highlights critical points of intersection between religious traditions and sociocultural phenomena, theology and philosophy, religious diversity and unity. The conference aims to expand the scholarly study of Said Nursi's thought, facilitate exchange of scholarly ideas, and offer excellent networking opportunities for those interested in the ideas of Said Nursi both in the USA and across the world. Selected papers will be published in a special issue of IJIS by July 1, 2025.

Invited speakers:  Marcel Becker and  Adrienne de Ruiter

In an era where digitalization permeates every aspect of our lives, the concept of dignity is being redefined and challenged in unprecedented ways. This conference and book volume seek to explore the multifaceted relationship between digitalization and dignity, addressing the challenges that technological advancements pose, for example, to our fundamental rights, privacy, and sense of self-worth. We invite scholars from various philosophical backgrounds and disciplines to contribute to this critical discourse.Issues of control, safety, respect, and justice in online spaces demand urgent attention, calling for a reevaluation of existing ethical frameworks and political philosophies. The opacity of complex algorithms, often referred to as the “black box” problem, poses significant challenges to explainability and transparency, making it difficult for users to understand how decisions affecting them are made. This also calls to address the need for robust regulation and policies to mitigate the adverse effects of digitalization on society.

Discussions on digital literacy are also encouraged, as empowering individuals with the knowledge to navigate digital spaces is essential for protecting their dignity and rights. Contributions that offer insights into the ethical considerations and propose solutions for enhancing fairness and reducing discrimination – for example with respect to vulnerable and marginalized groups – in digital systems are highly valued.

This call for papers seeks to foster a philosophical dialogue that not only critiques the current state of digital technologies but also envisions a future where dignity is upheld in the face of rapid technological advancement. Papers will be featured in a book volume dedicated to this theme.

We invite abstracts of 500 words (in Word format) and a brief CV. Travel and accommodation expenses up to 500€ can be covered. Please send your abstract before February 28 to the organizers @ this email address: <gottfried.schweiger@plus.ac.at>

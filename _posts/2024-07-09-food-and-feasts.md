FOOD FEST, FEASTS & GATHERINGS
------------------------------

deadline for submissions: 

October 1, 2024

full name / name of organization: 

Journal of Festival Culture Inquiry and Analysis

contact email: 

<festival.culture.edu@gmail.com>

Food fests, feasts, and gatherings address the role of food in events, gatherings, celebrations, and ceremonies. Exploring how people incorporate ideas about food into festival culture, including history, heritage, tradition, creativity, and social and political factors. 

In addition, it examines festivals in which food is not the main focus, yet contributes significantly to the atmosphere, memory, and tradition. It also looks at people's fascination with taste. In addition to examining these notions, we will also examine trends in the consumption and production of food.

We welcome submissions for next year's symposium (ISFC 2025) and journal (JFCIA 2026) examining food experiences through travel and the relationship between street food and food at festivals. We also encourage submissions that focus on policies, preparation, and organising festival food and food festivals. Practitioners are welcome to submit articles on their specific areas of interest in festival culture.

We welcome theoretically informed and empirically grounded narratives about festivals, feasts, rituals, gatherings, and celebration food, including but not limited to:

- History, heritage, and traditions

- Harvest

- Tourism

- Recipes and festivals

- Cultural identity and festivals

- Temporality

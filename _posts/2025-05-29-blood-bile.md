In the fictional world of 'Cvstodia', a nameless 'penitent' traverses a world in which the 'miracle' - a divine entity - is worshipped through physical torment and suffering in a gloomy body horror style. In doing so, 'Blasphemous' transforms the established conventions of the 'souls-like' genre: the difficulty typical of the genre and the cyclical approach to failure are theologically charged. The progress made by defeating boss enemies is enhanced by sacred weapons and rituals, while the level design is recontextualised as a spiritual pilgrimage. These elements are embedded in an elaborate ecclesiastical infrastructure and open up multiple levels of analysis, e.g:

    - Theological: Guilt, atonement and redemption as a cyclical game system\
    - Cultural-historical: appropriation of Andalusian religiosity\
    - Aesthetic: Transformation of Christian iconography into pixel art\
    - Narrative: Hagiographic narrative traditions as a game world\
    - Ludic: Integration of religious practices in game mechanics\
    - Psychological: Religious guilt induction as a game experience

With our planned diamon open access collective volume, we not only want to explore these levels of analysis, but also challenge the academic publishing tradition itself. The aim is not to collect isolated individual analyses, but to develop a conversation about the cultural significance and transformative power of games using the example of the Blasphemous games.

Instead of a collection of classic long papers, we would like to try out new approaches with you and take so-called 'interdisciplinarity' to the extreme. This call explicitly addresses interested parties from all academic disciplines (whether institutional or independent), from the gaming industry and gaming culture as well as creative professionals. If in doubt, please get in touch with your ideas and suggestions.

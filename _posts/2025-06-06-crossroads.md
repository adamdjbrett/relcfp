Laurent Pernot wrote, "Religion is intimately linked with words. Everyone knows that the spoken and written word plays an essential role in religion, as language is necessarily used to address the gods or God, to speak about the divine or the sacred, and to express religious feeling or awareness". Thus, Pernot called for an understanding of the role rhetoric plays in our expression and performance of religion.

One compelling reason for his deep understanding of the subject lies in rhetoric's unique transdisciplinary role. This role allows rhetoric to inhabit an intriguing space that intertwines various fields, such as the sciences, the arts, and other branches of the humanities. Within this dynamic context, rhetoric contributes to these disciplines and offers critical reflections that challenge their fundamental principles.

In exploring the intricate study of religion, we often encounter a significant oversight: the way we engage with and communicate our beliefs, the manner in which we construct persuasive arguments, and even our strategies for defending our religious viewpoints can lead us to undervalue the profound influence rhetoric has on our comprehension of religion and the discussions that arise from it.

Moreover, when we delve into the complexities of religion and its myriad functions, we frequently neglect to consider the critical role that race plays in shaping our perceptions. This oversight affects our understanding of religion and dictates the nuances of the language and rhetoric we choose to express our views. The interplay of race and rhetoric can fundamentally alter the discourse surrounding religious beliefs, underscoring the need for a more nuanced examination of these interconnected themes.

We invite scholars to contribute original research that explores the complex interplay between rhetorical practices and the dynamics of race and religion. This call for submissions welcomes a diverse range of approaches, enabling the examination of both historical and contemporary contexts. We are particularly interested in how these practices influence and are influenced by racial and religious factors, providing a nuanced understanding of these essential societal elements. We are especially eager for interdisciplinary perspectives that connect the study of rhetoric with fields such as theology, philosophy, political theory, cultural studies, and media studies, enriching our comprehension of how religious discourse shapes and is shaped by these varied contexts.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

-   Rhetorical analysis of sacred texts and sermons
-   Evangelism, proselytizing, and conversion narratives
-   The rhetoric of religious extremism or fundamentalism
-   Ritual and performance as rhetorical acts
-   Intersections of religion, rhetoric, and identity (race, gender, sexuality, etc.)
-   Visual rhetoric in religious iconography and media
-   Rhetorical strategies in racial and religious justice movements
-   Analysis of religious discourse in racial identity formation
-   The role of race and religion in political rhetoric
-   Intersections of race, religion, and gender in rhetorical practices
-   Digital media and the dissemination of religious and racial rhetorics
-   Comparative studies of racial and religious rhetorics across cultures
-   Critical examinations of the rhetoric surrounding religious racism and xenophobia
-   Prophetic rhetoric

We request that, prior to submitting a manuscript, interested authors initially submit a proposed title and an abstract of 200--300 words summarizing their intended contribution. Please send it to the Guest Editors or to the Religions editorial office (<religions@mdpi.com>). Abstracts will be reviewed by the Guest Editors for the purposes of ensuring proper fit within the scope of the special issue. Full manuscripts will undergo double-blind peer review.

## **2025––26 Call for Papers**

The Department of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder invites you to submit papers for the 2025––26 publication of our graduate and undergraduate journal, NEXT. As a peer-reviewed student journal, we are proud to feature insightful work from the next generation of religious studies scholars.

These may take the form of poetry, visual art, shorter works of creative writing, etc. All submissions and any questions should be emailed to the editorial board at <next@colorado.edu>.

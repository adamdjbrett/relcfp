The *Diakrisis Yearbook of Theology and Philosophy* invites scholars, theologians, philosophers, and researchers to contribute to our 2024 volume, centered on the compelling theme of "Suffering and Asceticism." This volume aims to delve into the profound and often complex relationship between human suffering, religious or spiritual discipline (*askesis*), and their broader theological and philosophical implications. In a world increasingly grappling with multifaceted forms of suffering---be it existential, social, or spiritual---this volume seeks to bring to light how theological and philosophical discourses interpret and respond to these challenges. We encourage submissions that explore the dynamic interplay between suffering and self-discipline, not only as theological and philosophical concepts, but also as realities that deeply influence human experience and societal structures. This edition aspires to provide a platform for critical reflection, scholarly dialogue, and interdisciplinary exploration, particularly focusing on the intersections and dialogues between theology, phenomenology, metaphysics, and other related fields.

In addition to papers focused on the main theme, we also welcome submissions for our Varia section. This section is open to high-quality papers on topics outside the central theme of "Suffering and Asceticism," encompassing a broad range of subjects within theology and philosophy. This provides an opportunity for scholars to contribute their insightful research and perspectives on various theological and philosophical topics, thus enriching the diversity and scope of the volume.

-   How does the concept of suffering shape theological discourse and praxis?

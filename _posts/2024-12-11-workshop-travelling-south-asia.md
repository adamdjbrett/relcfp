The South Asian Studies Council at Yale University is seeking applicants from scholars interested in participating in a workshop on "Traveling Expertise" on May 8-9, 2025 in New Haven. This small and informal workshop will provide an opportunity to share ideas and challenges in research the flow of experts and expertise from, to, and through modern South Asia.  

Participants will be asked to prepare a reflection of their own work in light of the themes of the workshop, and to circulate a piece of writing (published or unpublished) that exemplifies their work on traveling expertise. There is no expectation of preparing an article for a collective project though we may discuss possible future efforts at the conclusion of our workshop.

Thanks to The Edward J. and Dorothy Clarke Kempf Memorial Fund, the South Asian Council will cover travel (normally within North America) and lodging expenses for all participants. Scholars may be at any level, with the caveat that graduate students must have advanced to candidacy. 

To apply, please click the link below; the application requests a 1-2 page CV and brief description (500-700 words) relating your research to the program themes outlined in the project description below. Applications should be submitted by January 6, 2025.

This symposium aims to explore the intersection of philosophy and research on screen media including film, gaming, and handheld screens. Traversing both the problems that screen media raise for the discipline of philosophy, and philosophical approaches to screen hermeneutics, the symposium foregrounds critical and speculative approaches to understanding the proliferation of screen technologies in the 20th and 21st centuries, and the cultures that have formed around them. The project will feature a keynote lecture from Steven Conway (Swinburne) as well as presentations from Melbourne- and Sydney-based philosophers, film scholars, and games studies scholars.

All are welcome, registrations not required. Light refreshments will be provided during breaks.

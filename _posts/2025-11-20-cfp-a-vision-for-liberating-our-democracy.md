## **United Lutheran Seminary to Host "A Vision for Liberating Our Democracy" Conference, February 27--28, 2026**

### **Two-day gathering will explore the religious and racialized roots of American democracy and paths toward a more just future.**

United Lutheran Seminary (ULS) will host A Vision for Liberating Our Democracy: Examining the Religious and Racialized Roots of American Democracy on February 27--28, 2026, at its Philadelphia campus. The interdisciplinary conference will bring together scholars, activists, educators, and faith leaders to examine how religion and race have shaped democratic life in the United States and to explore liberative visions for the future.

The conference builds on a growing body of research that examines the theological, cultural, and political intersections of democracy, citizenship, and power. Participants will investigate how worldviews and faith traditions have informed concepts of governance, belonging, and personhood from the founding era to the present. The conference will highlight not only the Haudenosaunee Influence on American Democracy but also the historic and present contributions to Democratic thought by Black, Indigenous, and Latine communities, contributions which are often forgotten and ignored.

"As America's oldest Lutheran seminary, founded by an antislavery theologian 200 years ago in Gettysburg on land that was to become part of the Civil War's greatest battlefield, United Lutheran Seminary has always been part of the nation's conversation on race and freedom," said the Rev. Dr. R. Guy Erwin (Osage Nation), ULS president. "The Lutheran heritage of freedom of conscience and its emphasis on serving the common good draw us always from faith toward action. With this conference, our Seminary returns to the center of our current national debates."

Dean Teresa L. Smallwood said, "The American context is ripe for a time of reflection on the concept of democracy. "We the People" must evaluate our democratic commitments as we witness our nation entering a period of structural erosion. It is felt across all pockets of the nation. Have we redefined the governance schemata such that democracy is literally on life support? Do we continue to believe in the checks and balances of government? Is America a bastion for equality or have we reordered our commitments as a nation? These are some of the questions we must wrestle with at this conference."

"United Lutheran Seminary is committed to fostering public conversations about the moral and historical foundations of democracy," said the conference organizing committee member Adam DJ Brett. "By examining the ways religion and race intertwine with political life, we can better imagine inclusive and equitable systems of governance."

**[Environment and Society](https://rowman.com/Action/SERIES/_/LEXES)**, a book series published by [Lexington Books, an imprint of Bloomsbury Books](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/connect/latest-news/bloomsbury-acquires-rowman-littlefield-academic-business-and-assets/), is seeking proposals covering a broad range of **topics in environmental studies from the perspectives of the social sciences and humanities**. Learn more about the** 30 books already in the series** on the [publisher's website](https://rowman.com/Action/SERIES/_/LEXES): <https://rowman.com/Action/SERIES/_/LEXES>

Books in this series include both monographs and edited volumes that are grounded in the realities of ecological issues identified by the natural sciences. Our authors and contributors come from **disciplines including but not limited to anthropology, architecture, area studies, communication studies, economics, ethics, gender studies, geography, history, law, pedagogy, philosophy, political science, psychology, religious studies, sociology, and theology**. To foster a constructive dialogue between these researchers and environmental scientists, the Environment and Society series publishes work that is relevant to those engaged in environmental studies, while also being of interest to scholars from the author's primary discipline.

As scholars examine the environmental challenges facing humanity, they increasingly recognize that solutions require a focus on the human causes and consequences of these threats, and not merely a focus on the scientific and technical issues. To meet this need, books in this series help the reader understand contemporary environmental concerns, while offering concrete steps to address these problems.

**Please send proposals **for Environment and Society to General Editor Douglas Vakoch (<dvakoch@meti.org>) and Acquisitions Editor Courtney Morales (<cmorales@rowman.com>).

**Proposal Guidelines:**
**To submit a proposal, please send:**

-   **a prospectus **(see below for details)**
-   **a detailed table of contents**
-   **one or two sample chapters**
-   **your curriculum vitae**

If you are proposing a contributed volume, please include titles, affiliations, and brief resumes for each of the contributors. The prospectus should include:

-   A **description of the book**, describing the core themes, arguments, issues, goals, and/or topics of the work, what makes it unique, what questions it seeks to answer, and why you are qualified to write it (2--5 pages).
-   A description of your **target audience** (undergraduate or graduate students? scholars? professionals?).
-   An analysis of **competing or similar books** (including publishers and dates), indicating distinctive and original elements of your project that set it apart from these other works.
-   A list of **courses in which your book might be used** as a text or supplementary text, indicating the course level at which this book may be used.
-   An indication of whether any part of your manuscript has been **published previously**, and if it is a doctoral **dissertation**, what changes you are proposing to prepare it for publication.
-   The **length of the manuscript** either as a word count. Will there be figures, tables, or other non-text material, and, if so, approximately how many? If the text is not complete, please still estimate its final length, not including the non-text material.
-   If the manuscript is not complete, an estimation of **when it will be finished**. Is there a particular date by which you hope the book will be published (due to a historical anniversary, conference, etc.?)
-   The names of **four to seven respected scholars in your field** with whom you have no personal or professional relationship. Include their titles, affiliations, e-mail addresses, and/or mailing addresses.
-   An indication of whether the manuscript is under consideration by **other publishers**.

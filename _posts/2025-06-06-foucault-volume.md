Interested authors should submit a 300-word abstract, a 200-word biography, and a sample of a previously published chapter or article to 

<https://bit.ly/IndianTransCinema> 

no later than July 1, 2025.  

Each chapter will provide extensive references to both trans theory and film theory. Abstracts for proposed chapters should include several references to both trans theory and film theory, with an explanation for how these references will support your argument. Your list of references does not count toward the 300 word limit for abstracts.

Proposals that do not integrate references to film theory and trans theory in a compelling manner will be rejected.

Proposals should focus on films with a specifically trans focus, not merely a broadly LGBTQ focus.

If your chapter will have more than one author, please send a 200-word biography for each author. Proposals submitted by email will not be accepted. Abstracts and biographies should be submitted as Word documents, and previously published chapters or articles should be submitted as PDFs. Both Word files and PDFs should contain the author's name in the file names. Please include your email address in your biography file so we can contact you with our decision about your proposal.

Authors will be notified whether their proposals are accepted by July 20, 2025. Partial first drafts are due by September 1, 2025; solid first drafts of full chapters are due by December 1, 2025, and final versions that cross-reference other chapters extensively are due March 1, 2026. All chapters must include at least one author with a PhD. In your 200-word biography, please note the year and university where you earned your doctorate. Only previously unpublished works will be considered. 

We are seeking chapters that cover the full breadth of India's trans films, so we are not accepting proposals that explore films already examined by confirmed chapters. Please do NOT propose chapters on any of the following films, which are already covered in the handbook:

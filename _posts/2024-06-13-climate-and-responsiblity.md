## **Climate, Religion and Responsibility**

**Submission Deadline: June 30, 2024**

As a co-founder of the *International Journal on Responsibility* (IJR), Dr. Calvin Redekop, along with scholar Norman Kraus, Ph.D., actively debated the role that religion plays in addressing injustice. Focusing on the notion of "upstream responsibility," Redekop and Kraus (2017) argued that humankind is responsible for addressing various societal ills before these problems flow downstream and foster the destruction of society and the environment. To that end, this special issue is dedicated to the metaphor of upstream responsibility by examining how religion can be used to affect the global natural environment to promote environmental justice. Particular focus will be placed on responsibility surrounding climate change.

Manuscripts should be submitted to the IJR submission site and adhere to the formatting requirements of the journal, as detailed in the [author guidelines](https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/ijr/policies.html). All submissions will undergo a peer review process and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. Manuscript submissions will be considered on a rolling basis until June 30, 2024.

## **Free Speech and Responsibility**

**Submission Deadline: May 31, 2025**

Free speech is a fundamental right in a democracy. The extreme polarization of the contemporary political environment has highlighted issues with freedom of speech. These encroachments are undemocratic and violate basic principles of a free and just society. This special issue will focus on notions of responsibility and free speech by highlighting the complexities surrounding free speech in a global and multicultural society. Specific attention will be given to scholarship that examines attitudes towards free speech and theoretically advances the understanding of the association between freedom of speech and civic responsibility.

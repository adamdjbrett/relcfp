**Religion on the Plate: Critical Perspectives on Food & Religion**

**Conference organized by the Graduate Students of the Department of Religion, Columbia University in the City of New York**

**Conference Date:** April 2025 (date TBD) 
**Submission Deadline:** 20th January, 2025

Across religious traditions, food constantly emerges as an act, agent, practice, process, symbol, object, site, and mechanism through which religious selves, boundaries and communities are made and unmade.

The entanglements of historic and contemporary cosmologies and sacred traditions with food practices call for a framing of food beyond the limiting binary of the secular and the religious. Religion plays significant roles in how we conceive of and engage with questions of sustenance and the environment. From the politics of growth and production, to issues of food sovereignty and land use, as well as ecological relationships and bodily practices, religion mediates our relationships to food in fundamental ways. Examining these interplays allows for a critical site from which to trace broader networks of power and the political economies implicated within them, especially in the midst of settler colonialism, capitalist extraction, and neoliberal technologies.

Questions of the human, and its shifting counterpart, the non-human, sit at the intersections of political, religious, and technological relations, and food becomes meaningful, contested, resignified, and politicized within these complex entanglements. These bodies---their relations and their limits---are located at the confluence of the cosmological and the material in food production and consumption. This invites attention to questions of selfhood, subjectivity, identity, race, caste, and gender.

At the brink of planetary extinction, and in the backdrop of widespread food injustice imbricated in the industrialisation and commodification of food production and practices through the force of capital, can religious imaginations offer reparative ethical possibilities around food production and consumption? How do religious imaginations of food both collide and collude with neoliberal world-making projects?

The graduate students of Columbia University's Department of Religion invite paper proposals which examine the relationships between food and religion for the department's annual graduate student conference to be held in April 2025.

Below is a list of potential topics, themes, and intersections on which we encourage critical investigation, reflection, and analysis across disciplines:

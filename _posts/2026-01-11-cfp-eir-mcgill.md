Beyond Science and Religion
===========================


Over  the  last  century,  there  has  been  much  discussion  regarding  the  relationship  between  religion and science. Like the notion of religion, science --- and even the debate about how it co-exists with religion --- has a conceptual history. Even when fully traced, these histories do not give us fully formed and eternally true conceptual identities. The focus of this conference is whether religion  and  science  speak  to  each  other.  How  do  we  think  about  this  relationship  in  a  deeper  way than conflict? How can we move beyond this frame? What tools do we need to achieve this? We therefore seek submissions that treat the theme '***Beyond Science and Religion.***'  These include many variations or aspects, such as: What is religion? What is science? Are these compatible with one another? Is religious studies a science [*Wissenschaft*]? What relation is there, or should there be, between ontology and epistemology? Why do we conceptualize 'thinking' and 'believing' as two different processes? When we consider the state of the field of religious

studies  and  the  way  it  understands  itself  and  its  relationship  to  other  sciences  and  disciplines  --- or  even  its  relationship  to  'Science'  as  such  &emdash;  how  can  this  debate  be  furthered  and  deepened? What is beyond the now?

We invite participants to submit individual papers or panels (groups of 3-5) that reflect their research and interests by situating their work with the goal of moving forward the discussion involving the concepts of 'religion' and 'science,' broadly conceived. This bilingual English/French conference will be a space where, together, scholars and graduate students from different universities and backgrounds gather in Tiohtià:ke (Montreal) and find a place to share their  expertise  with  each  other  to  build  a  lasting  sense  of  academic  community.  Proposals  that  do not relate directly to these themes are also welcomed and will be seriously considered.

## ICTL 2024 : International Conference on Theology and Leadership

The University of Lucerne with its Professorship of Pastoral Theology and Institute of Leadership and Social Ethics (ILSE) of the Evangelische Theologische Faculteit, Leuven, Belgium (ETF) are organizing 2-day international conference on the topic of Leadership and Theology. The conference will start on the evening of 19 June 2024 with a social pre-opening.

Traditionally, models of leadership were built on a command-and-control framework, which then developed into more relational models. However, there is a wide-spread sense that these frames of leadership no longer function very well in a postmodern, digital age. Currently, the field of leadership studies suffers “from theory proliferation or theorria”. Moreover, leadership theories turn out to have significant dark sides.

The search is on for a different narrative of leadership. Leadership theories need better theoretical, epistemological, and empirical grounding. A fundamental question for more fruitful grounding is, “What is the S/spirit of our leadership?” This question queries the underlying motivations and powers that drive and structure our leadership. It is the question of the conference. The topic is both religious (“Spirit”), and more general since the spirit of the age marks, even permeates our organizations and their leadership.

This conference is designed for (but not limited to):

*  Understanding the S/spirit of the current theory and practice of leadership.
*  Exploring old and new approaches to S/spirit-filled leadership.
*  Discovering dimensions and qualities of S/spirit-filled leadership.
*  Experimenting with old and new practices of S/spirit-filled leadership.

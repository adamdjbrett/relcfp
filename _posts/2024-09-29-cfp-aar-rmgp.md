## Call for Proposals
2025 Rocky Mountain-Great Plains (RMGP) Regional Meeting
Hosted by the RMGP Region of the AAR & the Religion and Bible Society

On behalf of the University of Denver RMGP Regional Conference Committee, we invite proposals for panels and papers to be presented at the 2025 Rocky Mountain Great Plains Regional Meeting, which will be held at the University of Denver in Denver, CO, Friday-Saturday March 28-29, 2025. 

**The deadline for submissions is Friday, November 29, 2024, 11:59pm Mountain Time.**

We welcome proposals dealing with any aspect of the fields of religious studies and biblical studies. We seek proposals on all topics pertaining to religious traditions, beliefs, texts, or practices; historical periods; and biblical texts and their traditions. We also welcome proposals from scholars in a range of fields and disciplines; religious studies is an inherently inter and multidisciplinary field.

We welcome proposals for panels of multiple papers and accept proposals for single papers or other types of sessions, such as roundtables or book panels involving structured discussions of pre-circulated questions.

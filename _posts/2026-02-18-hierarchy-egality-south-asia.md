What roles do 'hierarchy' and 'egality', as values and practices, play in the everyday lives of South Asian traditions? Hierarchy as a value in the social life of Hinduism has been much discussed. Scholarship has tended to contrast a transhistorical Hindu hierarchy with egalitarian elements of Muslim, Christian, Buddhist and Sikh thought in South Asia, framing ubiquitous caste-like social forms among the latter traditions as anomalous. Yet careful studies of everyday life in the religious traditions of South Asia suggest that a far more heterogeneous set of social imaginaries and a far more complex entanglement of hierarchy and egality are, in fact, shaping the trajectory of both inter-caste and inter-religious relations and practices.

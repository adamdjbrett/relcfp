## Anthropology at the End of Worlds
### Due February 23, 2026
Northeastern University will host "Anthropology at the End of Worlds" on March 27--28, 2026! The conference explores how anthropologists can continue their work amid political turmoil, financial precarity, environmental ruination, and other conditions that foreclose access to communities and reshape ethnographic practice.

The event includes a pre‑conference workshop for New England--based anthropology PhD students and early‑career faculty on March 27, followed by two panels on March 28. Proposals should address how anthropology might adapt its methods and theoretical tools in a time of constraint, austerity, and global polycrisis.

Please submit a CV, a 250‑word abstract, and institutional information by February 23, 2026. More information and the submission form are available via the flyer's QR code.

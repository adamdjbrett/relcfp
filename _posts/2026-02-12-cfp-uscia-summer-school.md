### From Disciples to Followers: Questioning the Digital Experience of Religions Online

The 2026 UCSIA Summer School draws attention to the ambivalence and enthusiasm brought forth by religion going digital, both locally and globally. Recognizing the increasing importance of digital ways of experiencing and communicating about faith, religious practice and identity, this year's summer school focuses on the ways in which religious publics and religious forms of publicity are being reshaped by digital technologies, platforms and political economies. The online mediation of religion -- whether in terms of theology, ritual, ethics, or politics -- raises new questions about power, knowledge and ignorance. These questions emerge when long-standing religious traditions and their communities intersect with new industries and technologies.

The content of the summer school will be guided on the one hand by questions regarding the internal dynamics of religious traditions, such as:

-   In what way are religious traditions impacted by online publics and practices? In what way are religious traditions, beliefs and practices impacted by religious publics online?
-   How do religious traditions shape the formation of online publics?
-   How does the online sphere transform authoritative notions of what constitutes a 'genuine' or 'authentic' individual or collective religious experience?
-   Can the online sphere suffice for forming religious communities and cultivating religious selves, or does it merely serve as a tool or stepping stone to 'analogue' religion?
-   How do the new religious publics created by digital technologies interact with the 'traditional' ones?
-   Which role do online practices play in processes of globalization, uniformization or 'deculturation' of religious traditions?

On the other hand, questions of representation and (theo)politics will come to the fore, such as:

-   What do concepts such as scale, context and authority mean when it comes to religion and the online sphere? How can we better understand the more implicit presence of religion in social practices and politics, both on- and offline?
-   Which historical comparisons can be drawn between former and current media trends with regard to religious traditions and their influence on the social and political level?
-   How are debates on the racialization of religion, theological and religious nationalism, and moral vocabularies (re)shaped through digital media?
-   How do social media influence the relationship between religion, culture and the (democratic) state?

The UCSIA Summer School is a one-week mentoring programme that encourages junior scholars to explore the interdisciplinary ways of analysing the relationship between religion, culture and society. Key elements of the programme are expert lectures on theory-building and methodology, paper presentations by participants and individual mentoring by the faculty. For this interdisciplinary summer school on online publics and the digital experiences of religion, we welcome research projects from junior scholars (PhD or postdoctoral level) working in humanities, social sciences and law.

The UCSIA Summer School 2026, titled *From Disciples to Followers: Questioning the Digital Experience of Religions Online*, marks the end of a three-year cycle of summer schools, focused on the entanglements of religion and politics, the communities in which they take shape and function, and the injustices they entail or critique.

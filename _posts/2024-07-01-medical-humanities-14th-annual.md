The 14th Annual Midwestern Medical Humanities Conference will be on October 25th, 2024 via Microsoft Teams. The theme of this year's meeting is Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, which will comprise (at least) one track. Other track(s) will remain open for general submissions relating to medical humanities. 

We invite submissions for individual presentations, and we also encourage panel submissions that bring together participants from diverse backgrounds or academic disciplines. We further encourage proposals that involve community partners, would be of interest to the general public, and/or create opportunities for students. 

## Submissions
Submission Guidelines: Submissions should include name, department/institutional affiliation, project title, and an abstract not to exceed 500 words. Please also indicate whether your submission is for an individual presentation or a panel presentation---for panel submission, please include these details for all panelists. Proposals should be submitted by September 15 to <medical-humanities@wmich.edu>. Accepted presentations will be notified by October 1; conference registration will be required of all presenters. 

## Background
Background: The Western Michigan University Medical Humanities Conference met for twelve years, from 2011-2022. Moving forward, we have rebranded as the Midwestern Medical Humanities Conference; any interested university partners are encouraged to reach out about collaboration and co-sponsorship. We would like to host an in-person event in 2025.

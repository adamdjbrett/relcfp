Third Annual Juanita Brooks Conference

Utah State University

April 17-19, 2025

The Third Annual Juanita Brooks Conference will be held on April 17-19, 2025. Juanita Brooks wrote extensively about her family and other family relationships, biographies, as well as about southern Utah, most famously about the Mountain Meadows Massacre. We welcome papers related to Juanita Brooks' work in southern Utah and its surrounding Mormon communities. The program committee invites scholars young and old, local and global, to investigate all aspects of these themes:

1) Family

2) Biography 

3) Region (specific to southern Utah, Idaho, Arizona, and Nevada)

4) Religion

While topics may address Latter-day Saint or Mormon history, the conference is not specifically centered on either theme.

Please submit (1) a 150-word abstract for each paper or presentation and (2) a two-page CV for each presenter, including email and cell phone contact information. Previously published papers are not eligible for presentation. 

Limited financial assistance for travel and lodging at the conference is available to students, contingent, and independent scholars. If you wish to be considered, please include a proposed itemized budget with your submission. The deadline for proposals is **December 12, 2024**. Send proposals as a single PDF to the program co-chairs at <jstuartteaching@gmail.com> and amanda.<hendrixkomoto@gmail.com>. Acknowledgment of receipt will be sent ASAP. 

Notification of acceptance/rejection will be made by **January 10, 2025**.

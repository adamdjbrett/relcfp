Off-Script is a monthly Zoom conversation for graduate students and scholars interested in the critical comparative study of scriptures. Think of it as a get-together for our subfield to connect, converse, and collaborate. From professional development to workshopping ideas, Off-Script is your chance to network (in the best possible and least scary way) with scholars who get it and what you do.

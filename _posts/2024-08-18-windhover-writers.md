Dear Fellow Writers and Thinkers,

We are thrilled to announce the return of the *Windhover Writers' Festival*, taking place February 19-21, 2025, after a five-year hiatus. This year's festival promises to be a vibrant gathering that explores the profound intersection of faith and creativity, with a central theme of **The Vocation of Christian Literary Arts**.

The *Windhover Writers' Festival* has long been a cherished space for writers, scholars, and readers to connect, share their work, and delve into the power of words. We invite you to be a part of this exciting event by submitting a proposal for an individual or a panel discussion.

**Proposals:**

We are seeking proposals for engaging and thought-provoking discussions that explore the theme. Here are some potential areas of focus:

-   The role of the Christian writer in a secular world.
-   How faith informs and shapes the creative process.
-   The ethical considerations of Christian storytelling.
-   The unique challenges and rewards of writing for a Christian audience.
-   The intersection of faith and specific genres (e.g., fantasy, mystery, poetry).
-   Examining the legacy of Christian literary giants.
-   The evolving role of Christian publishing.
-   Fostering a vibrant Christian literary community.
-   Craft talks on specific elements of the writing process.
-   Community involvement projects and discussions
-   Creative Panels/Papers will also be considered on a more limited basis since we also invite contributors in the most recent *Windhover* issue to read at the festival.
-   We also welcome proposals that explore the theme in new and innovative ways.

**Submission Guidelines:**

-   Proposals should be no more than 300 words and should include:
-   A clear and concise title for your panel.
-   The names and brief biographies of all panelists (including yourself).
-   A description of the panel topic and its relevance to the festival theme.
-   An outline of the format of the panel discussion (e.g., lecture, Q&A, creative writing exercise).
-   Please submit your proposal by November 15, 2024.

We look forward to receiving your proposals and to welcoming you to the 2025 *Windhover Writers' Festival*. For more information and updates, please visit our [festival page.](https://www.umhb.edu/academics/writers/home#1845)

## [WOMEN IN JUDAISM: A MULTIDISCIPLINARY e-JOURNAL](http://www.womeninjudaism.org)


Since 1997, the journal is published exclusively on the Internet as a forum for scholarly debate on gender-related issues in Judaism. The journal's dissemination can be found at <https://wjudaism.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/wjudaism/about>

### Presently, submissions are invited for a special issue on Women Ordination in Judaism:

Women have continuously ordained as rabbis since 1972. By 2025 about 1800 women have become rabbis, mostly through Progressive Judaism, although also in selected cases in Orthodox Judaism. The vast majority were ordained in the United States but women also have been ordained in Europe and Israel. These women serve in various capacities worldwide: as congregational rabbis, in education, philanthropy, academia, the military, and organizational life. How would you characterize these changes? What has been the impact of these women on Jewish life, and Jewish society? What changes/developments might take place in the next two decades?

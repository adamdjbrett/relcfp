## Call for Journal Articles 
Now Open  
### Sensing Euphoric and Dysphoric Atmospheres (Volume 4) Following our symposium, we invite authors to submit papers for publication consideration. 
 

Our fifth annual online event addressed the theme of ‘sensing euphoric and dysphoric atmospheres’ in festive, celebratory, and ritual cultures. Taking an embodied perspective, we seek journal articles that focus on the role of corporeal perception in making sense of lived experience.

With regard to atmospheres, we focus on “the ways in which a multiplicity of bodies [are] part of, and entrenched in, a situation that encompasses it” (Riedel 2019:85). We aim to explore what existential phenomenology can reveal about carnivals, festivals, ceremonies, fetes, fairs, rituals, and other celebrations. Thus, exploring the euphoric and/or dysphoric atmospheres associated with these events and celebrations.

Our theme takes into account shared values, practices, customs, heritage, traditions, continuity, uniqueness, and differentiation within festive and celebratory culture. It is also important to consider the degree to which euphoria and dysphoria can be shared and learned, along with the camaraderie and familial aspects related to them.

 

Proposals may also address, but are not limited to, the following themes:

​

• Art, Craft, and Practice

• Carnivals (including Diasporic Carnivals)

• Celebration and Leisure

• Competition, Adjudication, and Legacy

• Costume and the Body

• Dance and Performance 

• Education

• Events

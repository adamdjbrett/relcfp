*[Postscripts: The Journal of Sacred Texts, Cultural Histories, and Contemporary Contexts](https://journal.equinoxpub.com/POST "https://journal.equinoxpub.com/POST")*, one of the major global publications exploring the reception history of religious texts, is making plans for a special issue devoted to the **Bible and Contemporary Fiction**

I will serve as the guest editor.

I hope to feature 4-6 essays (8000 words each, including references) on how biblical patterns, themes, and trajectories surface in works of contemporary fiction, broadly construed, from the non-western as well as western world.

Possible authors include, but are not restricted to, the following: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; J. M. Coetzee; Shusaku Endo; Jon Fosse; Neil Giffiths; Yaa Gyasi; Kathy Hepinstall; Daniel Hornsby; Paul Lynch; Kei Miller; Tova Mirvis; Anya Krugovoy Silver; Elizabeth Strout; and, Monica West

**The journal's managing editor and I have scheduled the issue for 2025. **

*Postscripts *publishes two issues annually. If we all agree to the first issue of 2025, submissions would be needed by March 2025 to allow for peer review and production.

**Questions and abstracts should be sent to <darren_middleton@baylor.edu> by August 31, 2024.**

7th Annual Philosophy of Religion Conference

## "Philosophy of Religion and War"

We live in a time of conflict. Whether in the so-called "culture wars" fought on the fields of social media and political disagreement or the rumor of conflict between nations that threatens to boil over into full scale war like those that rage in the Middle-East and elsewhere, our global culture, it seems, is one steeped in war and its imagery. Though by no means the only factor, religion often plays a role in how such conflicts begin and (perhaps ironically?) the same religions  offer hope for how they can be resolved. Are such conflicts justified or justifiable? Is peace possible? If it is, what does it reasonably look like? It is in light of issues and questions such as these that Weatherford College presents the 7th annual Philosophy of Religion Conference on the theme "Philosophy of Religion and War" on April 11-12, 2025.

*Myles Werntz, Ph.D. (Baylor University)* will deliver two Ben Arbour Memorial Lectures on "War and Peace in an Age of Bureaucracy." Dr. Werntz is Associate Professor of Theology in the Graduate School of Theology at Abilene Christian University. He is the author and editor of nine books in Christian theology and ethics, most recently *A Field Guide to Christian Nonviolence* (with David C. Cramer), and *From Isolation to Community,* 2022. He has written widely in the area of Christian social ethics and theology, particularly in the areas of war and peace, migration, and ecclesiology. 

In addition, **a call for papers is being extended to professional philosophers, professionals interested in philosophy of religion, or students of philosophy of religion as well as any professional or student in a field intersecting philosophy of religion and war. Any proposal on the conference theme is welcome, including but not limited to the role of religion in war and peace-making, just-war theories, political and social disagreement, the role of justice in conflict, social and political justice, military ethics, and pacifism. While proposals on the conference theme will be given special consideration, any proposal on any topic related to the philosophy of religion will be considered. Proposals must be 250-350 words and must be submitted no later than March 7, 2025. Proposals may be submitted to Greg Trickett at <gtrickett@wc.edu>. Presentations will be limited to a 45 minute time frame (approximately 30 minutes for presentation and 15 for Q & A). Presenters are encouraged to submit a full version of their paper for consideration in a possible published volume.**

Conference registration for Weatherford College faculty, staff, and students is free, but registration is still required (Weatherford College registrants may be required to show their school ID at the conference registration table). Registration for non-Weatherford attendees will be $40. In addition to the paper presentations and plenary sessions, there will be a Q & A dinner featuring our keynote speaker and some of our presenters at the close of the conference on Saturday. The dinner will be held at a local restaurant and will be self-pay. [You can register for the conference online](https://www.simpletix.com/e/philosophy-of-religion-and-war-7th-annual-tickets-199888).

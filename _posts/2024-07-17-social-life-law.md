Call for papers: Authoritarianism, law, and the remaking of society
===================================================================

Call For Papers June 2025

(Organised by the 'Social life of Law in Authoritarian Contexts' project funded by the Leverhulme Trust, at Soas, University of London)

Submission deadline: 16 September 2024

Authoritarian states and leaders across the world have often premised the centralisation of their power on the targeting, through law, of certain groups within the societies they rule over: ethnic, racial, and religious minorities; civil society groups and dissenters; and opposition political groups. From punitive border policing in the United States, to the banning of the 'International LGBT movement' in Russia, to the targeting of indigenous communities and their lands in Brazil, to the persecution of minorities and civil society groups in India, authoritarian leaders have used the law and non-legal violence to demarcate and demonise this purported enemy *within*.  Scholars have provided a range of concepts -- such as autocratic legalism, democratic authoritarianism, and authoritarian constitutionalism to describe the relationship between the expansion of state power and legality. This workshop, differently, seeks to draw attention to the social life of laws that are used by authoritarian states and leaders to re-compose societies. Away from strongmen at the top of states, our interest is closer to the ground: we are interested in exploring the messiness and complexity of how the laws that are used to target sections of societies unfold in everyday life.

These laws often seek to target the quotidian aspects of social and political life: what one can eat, where one can live, who one can love, who one can associate with, what one can say, and whether one is a member of a political community. In this workshop we look forward to submissions that seek to understand the social life of laws that are directed at the everyday life of targeted groups, including their food and dietary habits; where people can live, buy or use property; relationships between people of different communities and their association with groups and organisations; restriction and censoring of speech; limiting citizenship and political participation etc.

In this workshop we invite fieldwork-informed submissions that engage with the social life of law in authoritarian contexts. We would invite submissions that respond to one or more of the following prompts:

1.  Theorising contemporary authoritarianism and the use of law    What concepts can be offered to understand the use of law by certain states/regimes to change the composition of their societies? While scholars have offered a range of concepts to understand the agglomeration of power at the top of states, what concepts can we offer to think of how these same states use the law to re-imagine and recreate societies from bottom-up?

2.  Temporalities of authoritarianism    What is different between 'authoritarian legality' and 'ordinary' legality'? How do we understand and conceptualise the continuities and ruptures between the social life of these laws in authoritarian times and the ostensibly democratic periods that precede and follow them? For example, most of what contemporary authoritarian states enact through law to change their societies have been done or have been built on laws enacted in*less *authoritarian moments in their history. For example, the use of anti-terror laws against minorities and civil society groups in contemporary India is mirrored by the similar use of anti-terror laws in the previous regime. And yet, there is a feeling that something fundamental about its use has shifted. In this context, how do we conceptualise what is different about the contemporary 'authoritarian' moment?

3.  Agents of authoritarianism and patterns of enforcement  We are interested in conceptualising how these laws are being used: who are being targeted? What are the patterns of enforcement? How do the variety of institutions and officials -- the local police, lower bureaucracy, judges, lawyers -- understand and use these laws?

4.  Discursive strategies and everyday social life of laws  In exploring the 'social life of the law', we understand that law is not only present at its moment of application but is also made present through everyday social discourse. How do ideas derived from and about these laws circulate and how are they reformulated through everyday discussions and interactions? How do these ideas seep into society and alter the fundamentals of its discursive terrain?

5.  Modes of responses to authoritarianism  What forms of response are there from affected communities? How do people navigate new social realities inaugurated by these laws? What forms of community mobilisation occur in response to these laws? Beyond the idea of resistance, what concepts can we create to conceptualise the responses to the laws? In these responses, what discourses of citizenship, law, state, and authority are given life?

6.  *Doing* research in authoritarian contexts: Method and Methodologies  What are the methodological challenges of doing fieldwork in authoritarian contexts? What are the risks, limitations, and strategies that researchers employ in such milieus?

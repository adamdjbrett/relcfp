CFP: Religion and Democracy
===========================

- **Submission deadline:** January 20, 2025
- **Conference date(s):** May 22, 2025 - May 24, 2025
- **Conference Venue:** University of Notre Dame

## Details
-------

Political polarization has grown dramatically in the US since the 1970s, and has been connected to democratic erosion here and in a variety of international cases. It has also been accompanied by a growing 'God Gap' between political parties: religious citizens increasingly identify with the Republican party while secular citizens increasingly identify with the Democratic party. Some political scientists now worry that the US is on track to develop a 'confessional' party system in which partisans organize around religious or secular identities (Campbell, Layman, and Green, *Secular Surge,* 2021). This God Gap plausibly exacerbates polarization and, in so doing, indirectly contributes to democratic erosion.

In light of growing political conflicts surrounding religion, this conference aims to enrich philosophical discussion on the relationship between religion and liberal democracy. We invite abstracts that advance traditional debates about the role of religious reasons in public justification and democratic deliberation, as well as those that explore new questions bearing on how secular and religious citizens should cooperate in a liberal regime and how religion may contribute positively or negatively to democratic society. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

**We invite abstracts of 700-1000 words that address topics including, but not limited to, the relationship of religion to:**

- Public justification

- The accessibility of religious reasons

- Epistemic injustice

- Race, LGBTQ+ issues, sex and gender relations

- Applied issues pertaining to, e.g., abortion, education, exemptions

- Transformative liberalism

- Struggles for liberation and civil disobedience

- Civic virtues and vices (e.g., political courage, non-violence, love of enemy, patience, tolerance, intolerance, dogmatism, sectarianism)

- Recognition 

- Religious establishment and free exercise

- Illiberalism

**We especially welcome proposals that**

- bear on **religious traditions not well-represented in the current literature** in analytic political philosophy, e.g., Judaism, Buddhism, Jainism, indigenous religions, Islam, Confucianism, Orthodoxy.

- help** facilitate better dialogue between liberal and conservative religious perspectives. **

-** engage with theological perspectives more generally **including, e.g., the natural law tradition, Catholic social teaching, Reformed and Baptist traditions, and liberation theology. We strongly encourage but do not require such papers to either be written in the sytle of, or to engage with, literature in analytic political philosophy.

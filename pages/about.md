## ACREL
#acrel is a hashtag that stands for “the academic study of religion.” It was developed by religious studies scholars as a way of keeping track of the field (discipline ?) online. Thank you to [@burnidge](https://twitter.com/burnidge) for coining [#acrel](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23acrel&f=live "#acrel").

						<description>Publication Name: Call for Papers: Chiasma: A Site for Thought Volume 9: Philosophy / Fascism / State<br/><br/><p><strong>Chiasma<br/> </strong><strong><em>A Site for Thought</em></strong></p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br/> Volume 9: Philosophy / Fascism / State<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Theme and Scope: </strong></p>
<p>The interconnection(s) between philosophy and Fascism is a problematic that has roots as far back as Ancient Greece. While not Fascism in the modern sense of the word, the State—and in particular the tyrants utilizing it—either usurped philosophical ideas to justify their claims to power or had philosophers in their employ. As history marched forward, philosophy followed in tow, often subordinated to the State itself. Indeed, one could plausibly read Plato’s <em>Republic</em> or Hobbes’ <em>Leviathan</em> not merely as works of political philosophy in the abstract, but playbooks for authoritarian leadership, tools taken up by the “Crown Jurist of the Third Reich” himself, Carl Schmitt. More importantly, however, it is not just political philosophy that has been captured by authoritarianism—philosophy, and in turn, philosophers <em>themselves</em> have become idealogues, intimately cozying up with far-Right political ideals. One needn’t look far to verify such a claim. From the Right-Hegelianism of Giovanni Gentile in Italy, to Oswald Spengler’s connections to the Nazi State, to the political <em>and </em>metaphysical Fascism of Martin Heidegger, to the exposure of Paul de Man’s political proclivities, to recent uptakes of Right-Nietzscheanism by former NJIT lecturer Jason Reza Jorjani and “dissident” Internet philosopher, Bronze Age Pervert, it becomes increasingly difficult to make the claim that any given thinker is a one-off crypto-Fascist—an outlier—as within every decade of the 20th century, one can find <em>mainstream</em> philosophers imbricated with, if not Fascism properly speaking, then far-Right or latent Fascistic ideals.</p>
<p>Recognizing a Philosophico-Fascistic connection, Volume 9 of <em>Chiasma</em> seeks to follow the trajectory of Gramsci’s analysis and critique of Mussolini’s Italy, examinations of Nazi Germany by Bauman and Frankfurt School theorists such as Adorno and Horkheimer, and the countless other anti-Fascist thinkers who have attacked far-Right invocations at every juncture in history.</p>
<p>It is from this perspective that we encourage theorists to engage with contemporary Fascist studies, taking seriously the rising threat of Fascism (under whatever mask it may don). Given that, potential submissions may want to take up themes such as, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="_Hlk150173011"></a>the historical inter-relationship between philosophy and Fascism (or are the two <em>not</em>, in fact, imbricated?)</li>
<li>attempts to, following our theoretical forebears, <em>save</em> philosophy from Fascistic impulses which can be seen in all sub-disciplines (<em>e.g.</em>, the hierarchical world of the Platonic forms, the rigidly regulatory methodology of Kant, etc.)</li>
<li>the role Enlightenment (or anti-Enlightenment) thought as such plays in justifying far-Right ideals</li>
<li>the glorification and fetishization of violence / strength (<em>e.g.</em>, posthumous Nietzschean publications / readings, Georges Sorel, etc.)</li>
<li>the aesthetics of Fascism and/or the politicization of aesthetics <em>à la</em> the Italian Futurists, Walter Benjamin, etc.</li>
<li>pre- and post-Enlightenment figures of the human as they relate to exclusionary practices and/or contemporary uses and <em>ab</em>uses of biogenetic concepts (<em>e.g.</em>, Sylvia Wynter’s “Man1–Man2,” eugenic and/or ‘scientifically’ racist tendencies in the early biological theories of Carl Linnaeus, Georges Cuvier, Ernst Haeckel, and Julian Huxley, recapitulated by contemporary ‘race realists’ such as Jared Taylor or Steve Sailer, etc.)</li>
<li>links between Fascism and modernity (<em>e.g.</em>, Roger Griffin, Fernando Esposito, etc.)</li>
<li>contemporary instantiations of Fascism <em>à la</em> Internet “Right-Nietzscheanism,” (NRx) Neoreaction, Silicon Valleyite Monarchism, etc.</li>
<li>the connections / integrations of occultism and/or esotericism and Fascist ideologies</li>
<li>(<em>e.g.</em>, Julius Evola, Miguel Serrano, etc.)</li>
<li>links between deep ecology and “Ecofascism” (<em>e.g.</em>, Savitri Devi, Pentti Linkola, etc.)</li>
<li>psychology / psychoanalysis and Fascism (<em>e.g.</em>, Wilhelm Reich, Georges Bataille, etc.)</li>
<li><em>what</em> Fascism actually is and/or how it functions (<em>e.g.</em>, Umberto Eco’s <em>Ur-Fascism</em>, Robert Paxton’s <em>Anatomy of Fascism</em>, and/or other<em> </em>seminal definitional texts)</li>
<li>what the actual <em>philosophy of Fascism as such</em> is (<em>e.g.</em>, M.N. Roy, Mario Palmieri, Pierre Drieu la Rochelle, etc.)</li>
<li>as yet un(der)-theorized account(s) of some other aspect(s) of Fascism not mentioned above</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day (reworking Jacques Derrida), Fascism can survive—and indeed, thrive—because of “the semantic vacancy or indetermination at the very center of the concept.” If we shine a light on the relationship between philosophy and Fascism—and the ways in which it appropriates philosophical ideas, be they seemingly neutral metaphysical accounts of the world or problematic philosophies of science—we may strip it of its indeterminacy and more accurately fix our sights on our target. If Fascism exists today, it is only because “[w]e do not yet know what we have inherited.”</p>

			<title>[ September 8, 2024 -  September 15, 2024] Conference or similar: SMR Summer Institute with Julia Kristeva &quot;The Feminine in an Age of Anthropological Transformation&quot;&quot;</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/116398</link>
						<description>Venue: Olympada<br/><br/><p>- Short Syllabus with the tentative agenda and practical information -</p>
<p>In the accelerated anthropological transformation at the beginning of this third millennium, women are at once an emerging force, on the same level with its upheavals in values and identities, AND an irreducible otherness—object of desire, fear, and envy, of oppression and exploitation, of abuse and exclusion. Julia Kristeva’s masterclass will focus on the transformative potential of what she conceptualizes as the feminine: not femininity, not femaleness or womanhood but a specific aspect of the human psyche which might be the proper engine of our capacity to change. </p>
<p>Lecture 1. Feminine Oedipus or, about female sexuality. (Kristeva)</p>
<p>Lecture 2. The Female Genius (Arend, Klein, Colette) (Kristeva)</p>
<p>In the second part of the course Miglena Nikolchina will approach works of science fiction (the TV series Battlestar “Galactica,” Blade Runner and BladeRunner 2049, Alien- from the first one to Prometheus and Alien: Covenant) in order to foreground the role that maternity and (pro)creation play in attempts to define the human vis-à-vis the machine. Kristeva’s concept of the feminine will be examined in the framework of what Freud termed “psychic revolution of matter”: the revolution which is arguably at the center of Kristeva’s thought from her earliest writing to her latest.  </p>
<p>Lecture 1. Being Born or Being Made? Kristeva’s Concept of the Maternal Chora and the Semiotic. (Nikolchina)</p>
<p>Lecture 2. Making Soul by Making Flesh: Kristeva’s Concepts of Signifiance and Transubstantiation. (Nikolchina)</p>
<p>The third part offered by Katarina Kolozova focuses on Marx’s notion of “fetish” as commodity or, if the term fetish is problematic in any way, then, quite simply on the problem of commodity as reification of abstraction. There is an unnegotiable categorical distinction between the abstract and the material or physical. The distinction is, let us reiterate, categorical not ontological. There is a distinction between the two and they should not be conflated or rendered mutually interchangeable. We will look at the dialectics of femininity as commodified and fetishised value (Irigaray), its comparability with Marx’s formulae of M-C-M and how philosophy operates as a signifying automation or pleasure principle (Lacan, Laruelle, and the foreclosure of the real).  We will also try to tie this discussion with Kristeva’s thesis of the Feminine Oedipus.</p>
<p>Lecture 3. Comparability of the Machines of Patriarchy, Capital and Philosophy: The Fate of the Remnants of Flesh and femininity (Kolozova)</p>
<p>Practicalities: NB: Hybrid participation is an exception, not the rule We made sure that we follow the ancient Greek principle of philosophical study, including also arts and sciences, being scholē (leisure time, pleasure and play). The institute is placed in what was once Stagira after all, the birthplace of Aristotle. The program is structured in such a way that it allows for enjoying the sun and the beach of the Aegean Sea as well as socialising with the rest of the group, visiting local tavernas, taking trips to nearby archaeological sites and visits to Thessaloniki and other interesting nearby location. Olympiada is the contemporary name of ancient Stagira, the birthplace of Aristotle, located in the northern part of the region of Macedonia of Greece. The climate is mild, the area is surrounded by continental rather than Mediterranean flora and fauna. It is surrounded by green mountainous area. Mount Athos is only 70-80 miles away. Hybrid format module: For those who cannot make it to the Campus, we have reserved the option for online participation; please, bear in mind that its possibilities are limited compared to the in-person participation (interaction with faculty and community, informal program, presentations, etc.).

<p>The Asian American Religious Studies Unit invites papers for the American Academy of Religion Western Region Annual Meeting 2024.Focusing on the definition and redefinition of religious/secular, the unit wishes to explore how these categories are shifted and created through media and politics across boundaries geographical and otherwise. How are Asian American religions affected by movement in these categories? How has transnationalism shaped debates around what is and is not religion? How has it shaped the lived experience of Asian American communities? This year we seek papers concerned with the following themes: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Transnationalism</li>
<li>Materiality</li>
<li>Space/Place</li>
<li>Categories of Religion and the Secular</li>
<li>New Religious Movements</li>
<li>Media and Religion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

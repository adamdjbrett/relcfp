						<description>Publication Name: Philosophy and Society<br/><br/><p><strong>Call for Papers: Hegel and Postmodernism</strong></p>
<p>The editorial team of <em>Philosophy and Society</em> is pleased to announce a call for papers for the 2024 Special Issue, which is dedicated to the topic “Hegel and Postmodernism”. The issue will be edited by Đorđe Hristov (Institute of Philosophy and Social Theory) and Saša Hrnjez (University of Florence).</p>
<p>If we consider postmodernism as a condition, stance, or form of discourse that challenges the legacies of modernity, tracing its origins to the Enlightenment era, with its emphasis on reason, universality, and progress, then Hegel, as the pinnacle of modernity and the embodiment of Lyotard's grand narrative, may initially seem entirely at odds with the postmodern perspective. Nonetheless, Hegel's philosophy continues to be a subject of contention and debate within many postmodern viewpoints, as well as in efforts to define the very essence of postmodernity. Furthermore, it was Hegel who offered the first systematic (self)critique of modern subjectivity and abstract rationality, a critique often viewed from a postmodern standpoint as a dialectical affirmation of modernity. If, following Vattimo’s interpretation, Nietzsche’s death of God was the first philosophical event that made possible the passage to postmodernity, can Hegel’s philosophy of history be seen as a “preparation” of that event? And if certain elements of Hegel's philosophy can be reconciled with some postmodern perspectives, isn't the quintessentially Hegelian concept of the Absolute (Idea, Spirit, Knowledge) an insurmountable obstacle within the postmodern framework? On the other hand, what would be a Hegelian respond to the growing realization that the postmodern play of multiple worlds and languages might not lead to increased freedom and decreased violence? To paraphrase Slavoj Žižek, can Hegel help us better comprehend post-Hegelian phenomena that Hegel himself could not have envisioned? These are only some questions that set the stage for this volume. The forthcoming special issue is dedicated to the interplay between Hegel’s philosophy, the broader landscape of postmodern philosophy, and the concept of postmodernism itself. The idea is to reassess the critical objections toward Hegel coming from postmodern thinkers, but also to reactivate Hegelian figures that can be deployed in the understanding of postmodernity.</p>
<p>We welcome contributions that delve into any topic or issue concerning the relationship between Hegel’s philosophy and postmodern thought, as well as the concept of the postmodern. We equally encourage submissions that scrutinize Hegel's position within postmodern philosophy and those that offer fresh perspectives on the postmodern condition from a Hegelian vantage point. Papers may explore figures explicitly associated with postmodern philosophy (such as Lyotard, Vattimo, Rorty, etc.), positions that intersect with the postmodern moment (like Derrida, Baudrillard, Deleuze, Butler, Foucault, Laclau, etc.), as well as those who have critically engaged with postmodernism (such as Habermas, Harvey, and Jameson). The scope of relevant themes for this special issue spans across a wide spectrum, encompassing areas such as social and political theory, ethics, history, religion, metaphysics, and aesthetics. We encourage both historical papers grounded in detailed textual analysis and papers that engage with contemporary debates.</p>
<p>Should you have any uncertainties about the suitability of your paper for this special issue, please do not hesitate to contact one of the editors before making your submission.</p>
<p>Đorđe Hristov: george.hristov@ifdt.bg.ac.rs</p>
<p>Saša Hrnjez: sasa.hrnjez@unifi.it</p>
<p>Papers should be 7000 to 10000 words in length and follow the ASA citation style. Submissions will be peer-reviewed (double blind).</p>
<p>The deadline for submissions is <strong>February 29, 2024</strong>.</p></description>

			<title>[ June 6, 2024 -  June 9, 2024] Conference or similar: Touching the World - Luce Irigaray Circle &amp; NSU</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/115538</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The 12th meeting of the Luce Irigaray Circle is a three-day interdisciplinary conference devoted to the scholarship and creative work on, or inspired by, the thought of Luce Irigaray. Luce Irigaray’s work has influenced scholarship across multiple fields including Philosophy, Gender Studies, Queer Theory, Trans Studies, Literary and Culture Studies, Indigenous Studies, Classics, Religious Studies, Political Theory, Linguistics, Art, Architecture, Music, Performance Studies, and Legal Theory, etc. The Circle cultivates a space for honoring and interrogating the question of sexual difference by supporting the multiple research trajectories, methods, and projects inspired by Irigaray’s thought.</p>
<p>Luce Irigaray has called for a new human being and a new way of thinking based on her philosophy of sexual difference. Central to this idea of being and thinking are touch and being touched as forms of interaction and inter-affections that are endless processes of becoming and transformations. This year´s conference draws its theme from touching and being touched by the world in all its manifestations. Reflections on the following topics are welcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexes, genders, differences</li>
<li>New human being and humanity</li>
<li>Sharing desire, sharing the world</li>
<li>Erotic thinking</li>
<li>Embodiments and languaging</li>
<li>Ethics of sexual difference</li>
<li>Temporalities and spatialities</li>
<li>Vegetal thinking, breath and breathing</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Self-affection and the sensible transcendental</li>
<li>Liberation and repression</li>
<li>Race and racism</li>
<li>Disconnection, coloniality, war</li>
<li>Climate change</li>
<li>Capitalism as patriarchal economy and polarization</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers should be delivered in 20 minutes to leave 10 minutes each for discussion. Please note that the IC conference organizers are planning an edited volume based on the conference and request the right of first review on all accepted papers. If you would like to submit a proposal, please send the following information at https://forms.gle/CJDHLwiWaCwuyx1d6 by January 10th, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>For individual papers and works in progress: the title of your paper, an abstract (500 words maximum); 5 keywords; a list of no more than six references (not to be included in the word count)</li>
<li>For complete panels (approx. 3 papers per panel): the title of the panel; an abstract explaining the theme of the panel (300 words maximum); 5 keywords for the panel; titles and individual abstracts for each paper (300 words each maximum, plus a list of up to six references for each paper).</li>
</ul>
<p>Creative Work:</p>
<p>In addition to academic presentations, the Circle invites proposals for creative work related to the work of Luce Irigaray. Past events have included theatrical and musical performances, poetry readings, art installations, and more. Submissions should include an abstract describing the work, materials that represent it (for example, poetry excerpts or photos) and an explanation of the technical needs related to presenting the work.</p>
<p>Work-in-Progress Session(s):</p>
<p>In addition to traditional academic presentations, we welcome works and thinking in progress. If you would prefer to participate in a closed discussion section for works in progress, indicate “Works in Progress” in the subject line of your submission. If you are admitted to the works in progress track, we will ask you to send in an unfinished piece of writing (non-academic as well as academic texts are welcome) ahead of the conference (by 1st of May 2024), which will be shared with others who have signed up to join the WIP-session(s). During the conference small presentations and conversations around these works will be hosted in closed sessions.</p>

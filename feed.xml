<p><strong>AMERICAN ACADEMY OF RELIGION WESTERN REGION (AAR/WR)</strong><strong> <strong>2024 ANNUAL CONFERENCE In-Person Conference at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV)</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>March 15-17, 2024</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Asian American Religious Studies Unit invites papers for the American Academy of Religion Western Region Annual Meeting 2024.Focusing on the definition and redefinition of religious/secular, the unit wishes to explore how these categories are shifted and created through media and politics across boundaries geographical and otherwise. How are Asian American religions affected by movement in these categories? How has transnationalism shaped debates around what is and is not religion? How has it shaped the lived experience of Asian American communities? This year we seek papers concerned with the following themes: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Transnationalism</li>
<li>Materiality</li>
<li>Space/Place</li>
<li>Categories of Religion and the Secular</li>
<li>New Religious Movements</li>
<li>Media and Religion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>deadline for abstract submission to AAR/WR is November 15, 2023</strong>. Scholars of all levels are invited to participate in this dialogue. Please send your abstracts (250 words) to Shannon Toribio (<a href="mailto:shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu">shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu</a>).</p>

			<title>[ December 17, 2023] Conference or similar: Science &amp; Scientist 2023: Life &amp; Cognition at the Intersection of Science, Philosophy, &amp; Religion</title>

<p>Short description:</p>
<p>In her 1983 Nobel lecture, Barbara McClintock challenged 21st-century science to “determine the extent of knowledge the cell has of itself, and how it utilizes this knowledge in a ‘thoughtful’ manner when challenged.” Since then, significant scientific progress has been made in recognizing that all cells are cognitive and that they exercise self/nonself discrimination in various ways. These discoveries proved Humberto Maturana’s hypothesis that  “[l]iving systems are cognitive systems and living as a process is a process of cognition [...] for all organisms with and without a nervous system” and challenge theories that reduce cognition/consciousness to neuronal correlates, “the minimum neuronal mechanisms jointly sufficient for any one specific conscious experience,” since a single nerve cell already exhibits conscious decision making. </p>
<p>These discoveries also prompted scientists to recognize the need to clarify the concept of “self.” While such efforts advocate a non-reductionist systems approach, they avoid the first-person perspective of selfhood in favor of third-person perspectives. But the first-person perspective is the only concrete account we have of the self. This situation demonstrates the necessity for phenomenological approaches to self-inquiry that transcend systems thinking by embracing conceptual thinking. G.W.F. Hegel’s philosophy demonstrates this method’s applicability for comprehending Logic, Nature, and Spirit. Humanities scholars at Princeton University have conducted several programs engaging with Hegel’s philosophy since 2017, including one individual (now a Research Associate at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton) currently studying Hegel’s logical category of life, its transition to the category of cognition, and the implications this has for comprehending organic life and artificial intelligence.  </p>
<p>Vedānta philosophy describes that our consciousness determines our experience, i.e. our knowledge of objects and the world determines the world we live in and how we perceive those objects. To the extent that “embodied cognition” refers to the understanding that cognition/consciousness is enmeshed in the relationship between a body and interactions with its environment, it coincides with Vedāntic knowledge in that cognition/consciousness is intertwined in the relationship between a body and its interactions with the environment, but understanding the body as a material thing intended to exploit the environment to maximize individual enjoyment produces a very different experience than identifying as spirit fixed in uninterrupted joyful loving service to the Supreme. </p>
<p>We hope to clarify the distinction between cognition and consciousness to accurately determine the various behaviors of particular living entities. An etymological analysis suggests considering cognition as a less sophisticated faculty than consciousness. Cognition is an initial step of mediated thought where an object is reflected into the mind and a preliminary mental representation is formed, which is enough to navigate the relatively simplistic experience of cellular life and other lower lifeforms such as insects and plants. The phrase “lower lifeforms” is not being used in a derogatory way but to denote living entities whose activities seem mainly absorbed in exercising volition and cognition while responding to immediate environmental circumstances without exhibiting symptoms of a sophisticated internal emotional experience. Consciousness, on the other hand, denotes an identity-in-difference between subject and object that requires a dialectic approach to comprehend. This is a further development of thought where the conscious agent knows apparently external objects as identical to itself, as well as recognizing its difference from objects. In addition to exercising volition and cognition, conscious entities like elephants, cows, and humans have a more mediated relationship with their environment allowing them to form emotional attachments to things other than themself. Scientists recognize that “there is continuity between humans and other animals in their emotional (and cognitive) lives; that there are transitional stages among species, not large gaps; and that the differences among many animals are differences in degree rather than in kind.” When one experiences an identity with something other than oneself, a feeling of inner connection is established. So, living cells may be volitional and cognitive, but not emotional. This indicates an evolution of consciousness throughout lifeforms where different stages of development are distinguished by the degree to which and particular manner in which a living entity expresses volitional, cognitive, and emotional activity. </p></description>

						<description>Publication Name: CALL FOR PROPOSALS - PAPER INCUBATOR<br/><br/><p>The project Concepts of God and the Variety of Theisms in Indian Traditions: Towards a Theistic Theory of Consciousness is an initiative that has as general goals (1) to philosophically reconstruct concepts of God in Indian theistic (or theistically inclined) traditions, namely from Vaishnava, Shaiva, Shakti, Sikh, indigenous or other religious perspectives on the subcontinent, and (2) to investigate the extent to which issues explored by such traditions can contribute to the philosophy of consciousness. It is supported by funding totaling $260,000 from the John Templeton Foundation.</p>
<p>As part of the project, we will organize a paper incubator: a systemized and sponsored mentorship program designed to help junior and mid-career philosophers and scholars of Indian studies to develop submitted papers proposals into publishable articles. Each selected researcher will work in cooperation with a tutor, who will help the candidate transform their text into a high-quality publishable article. Each successful applicant will receive a grant of $ 3,000. They will have 18 months to write their article, which must be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. Each researcher must present their work in at least one of our three conferences (a bonus of $ 1,000 will be given to those who attend the conference in person). The grant will be awarded through bank transfer, on which bank and federal revenue fees may apply.</p>
<p>Proposals must be written in English in the form of an extended abstract of a maximum of 2,000 words, clearly describing (1) the problem that will be addressed, (2) the context in which the problem has been approached (preferably through a brief literary review), (3) the goal of the paper, and (4) the way the proponent wants to achieve this goal. The proposal should also contain (5) a list with the relevant bibliography. The general intended approach must be consistent with analytic philosophy of religion. Proposals must address some of the questions and general goals of the project. Applicants must be PhD candidates, or have completed their PhD within a maximum of 6 years. We welcome proposals both from philosophers and Indian Studies scholars. The proposal must be sent along with a summarized CV of the applicant to god.and.consciousness@gmail.com by January 5, 2024. The list of selected proposals will be posted on the website on January 15, 2024. In total, 12 proposals will be selected, 6 of which will (ideally) be from Brazilian scholars.</p></description>

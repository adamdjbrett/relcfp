			<title>[ April 15, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experiences</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106913</link>
						<description><p><u>Overview</u></p>
<p>The Center for Philosophy of Religion at Rutgers University is pleased to host an in-person, working-papers conference on the Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experience. We are seeking abstracts (150-350 words) from those interested in participating. The tentative date is 15-16 April 2023. And the deadline for submission is 28 February 2023. Participants with accepted submissions will be given hotel accommodations and a modest honorarium to help defray travel costs.</p>

<p><u>Theme</u></p>
<p>The overall theme of the workshop is the Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experiences. Philosophers of religion frequently assign religious experiences important epistemic roles, such as justifying religious beliefs. But religious experiences of the kind philosophers are interested in are also studied in other fields as well, such as psychology and religious studies. However, the psychology and epistemology of religious experiences are presumably not independent; studying them together is likely to be insightful in various ways. To that end, we are interested in bringing together scholars working on the psychology and epistemology of religious experiences. Potential topics include:</p>
<p>·       The nature of religious experiences</p>
<p>·       Taxonomies of religious experiences</p>
<p>·       Potential psychological mechanisms and accounts of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The relation between perception and religious experiences</p>
<p>·       The epistemology of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The interactions between the psychology and epistemology of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The relation of CSR to religious experience</p>
<p>Any proposed papers on these topics, or similar ones, are welcome. Papers exploring interdisciplinary approaches are also welcome.</p>

<p><u>Instructions</u></p>
<p> Please submit an abstract (150-350 words), long abstract (350-650 words), or full paper to Timothy Perrine at <a href="mailto:tp654@scarletmail.rutgers.edu">tp654@scarletmail.rutgers.edu</a>. In a separate document please provide your name, institutional affiliation (if applicable), and contact information. Submission deadline is 28 February; acceptances will be decided by 5 March; and the workshop will be held 15-16 April.</p></description>

As such an element, religion bears and constitutes meanings. According to Brent Nongbri’s <em>Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept</em> (2013), we do not have any scientifically proven knowledge and scholarly consensus regarding the question as to what precisely constitutes a religion. Therefore, the question would be: How do such meanings arise that have shaped the idea of ​​religion and its cultural scope for thousands of years? In the cultural history of religion, we work with images, texts, rituals, music and many other media that transmit an idea of ​religion to humanity. We might be able to understand religion as a system of worldviews that enables us to define beliefs, morals, attitudes, behaviors, practices and, more generally, that relates humanity to transcendental, spiritual and supernatural elements.</p><p>This Special Issue is interested in the transmission of such a system through art, but mainly through literature, focuses its perspective on the representation of Islam in Germanophone literature and culture from the Enlightenment to the present and aims to shape the literary discourses on Islam in the context of following questions:</p><ol><li>How does literature create the encounter between German-speaking and Islamic cultures and what ideas, images and meanings have shaped the literary discourses of Islam from the Enlightenment to the present day?</li><li>What kind of texts or text types prove to be outstanding in the construction of images of Islam in Germanophone literature? What meanings do they produce and how do those meanings affect the idea of the cultural otherness?</li><li>Before the Islamic invasion, the Persian Empire and the Ottoman Empire were self-contained cultural spaces. From an intercultural und interreligious perspective, how does the Germanophone literature describe the influence of Islam on Persian and Ottoman Cultures, and vice versa?</li><li>Since the Enlightenment, what influence exert various images of Islam on the intellectual and controversial debates on Islamic-embossed cultures?</li><li>Discourses on culture conventionally take place in the hermeneutic field of tension of the Own and Foreign. Cultural difference dominates. How are cultural differences constructed on the basis of Islam and what meanings do they produce? What role do similarities play in cultural encounter?</li><li>Travelogues, poetry and novels are genres that tell stories by producing certain images with particular meaning. How are those meanings culturally ingrained and how do they influence the cultural understanding of Islam since the Enlightenment?</li><li>Since the turn of the millennium to 2000s, a series of political occurrences have changed our societies. How does Germanophone literature contend with these social transformations and ?</li></ol><p>Beyond those primary questions, other approaches are also welcome that enrich cultural discourses of Germanophone literature on Islam, especially in the present, constructively and beyond conventional debates. We also strongly invite contributions that deal with art, music, paintings and film.</p><p>Contributors are invited to use research in the field of theories of culture and literature, theories of discourse, narratology, and film studies to explore aspects of the dynamic relationship between culture and religion.</p><p>Prof. Dr. Hamid Tafazoli<br/><em>Guest Editor</em></p><div><b>Prof. Dr. Hamid Tafazoli</b> is a professor at Bielefeld University.</div><p><b>Submission Planning </b></p><p>Deadline for the submission of abstracts: <strong>15 March </strong><b>2023. </b></p><p>Submission of final manuscripts:<b> 15 June 2023. </b></p><p><b>Submission Criteria: </b> </p><ul><li>Abstract and a short biography should be sent to <strong>Hamid Tafazoli</strong> (<span><a href="mailto:hamid.tafazoli@uni-bielefeld.de">hamid.tafazoli@uni-bielefeld.de</a> </span>) and <strong>Sylvia Hao</strong> (<a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a>)</li><li>Final articles, in English only, should be at least 5000 words long; a 150-word abstract and 5 keywords should also be submitted.  </li><li>Authors can include image files (tables, maps, graphs, photographs …) in ..jpg; they should ensure that images are free of rights (or that rights have been obtained).  </li><li>Each article will be peer-reviewed by at least two anonymous referees.</li></ul><p>For further inquiries, please contact: Sylvia Hao for <em>Arts</em>, <strong>Sylvia Hao</strong> (<a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a>) and Editorial Office of <strong><em>Arts</em></strong>（<a href="mailto:arts@mdpi.com">arts@mdpi.com</a>）</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Sylvia Hao in Beijing Now:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a></div></div><p>Editorial Office in Switzerland:</p>

He was influential in the development of the reincarnate lama tradition, a system that led to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas and the succession-by-reincarnation governance of Tibet for 300 years (1642–1959). During his travels in Mongolia and China, Karma Pakshi influenced Mӧngke Qan’s social policies and was tortured and imprisoned by Kubilai Qan. In ‘internal exile’ near Xanadu, Karma Pakshi composed several of his philosophical works.</p><p>For online &amp; in-person booking: <a href="https://tickets.ox.ac.uk/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=bodnf&amp;c=jannf" rel="nofollow">https://tickets.ox.ac.uk/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=bodnf&amp;c=jannf</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Charles Manson,</p><p>consultant librarian for Tibetan Studies at the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford University.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:charles.manson@bodleian.ox.ac.uk">charles.manson@bodleian.ox.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://visit.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/event/jan23/the-invention-of-reincarnation" target="_blank">https://visit.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/event/jan23/the-invention-of-reincarnation</a></div></div></div></description>

The aims and methods of liberal education as a pedagogical exercise and a cultural practice need to be examined within the dynamic intellectual, social, economic, and political contexts created by today’s unprecedented movement of peoples and intersections of cultures. Variously seen as forced migration, exile, dislocation, statelessness and even environmentally induced displacement, the Global refugee crises present multilocational and multilayered challenges. This conference aims to create a focused debate around not only the phenomenon of refugee migration but also seeks to understand the crises as within a continuum of other constructions of the refugee as the non-Western Other. This construction leads to the near necessity of speaking of decolonization as an imperative located possibly within liberal education and its practices. The intertwining of the refugee experience with Indigenous communities’ lived experience calls for thoughtful intervention. Can liberal education aid in the process of decolonization? Is it a singular process, or are there multiple ways in which decolonization can occur? What does decolonization look like?</p>
<p>The aims of liberal education are variously articulated as an instrument for the teaching of transferable practical skills, the making and enabling of responsible citizens, or the cultivation of virtue, self- knowledge, and broad, general wisdom. These aims and the means of achieving them all need to be reassessed as our wider society is transformed by both by the infusion of new peoples and the increased engagement of Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The Department of General Education at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and its partner, Medicine Hat College, in Medicine Hat Alberta, Canada and U of Lethbridge invite papers and panel presentations      for our fifth Liberal Education Conference on the theme of <em>Liberal Education in an Era of Migration, Refugee Crises, and Decolonization. </em>Broad topic areas related to this may include, but are not excluded to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the challenges to the historical grounding of liberal education in a time of increased cultural heterogeneity</li>
<li>the place of liberal education in the construction of a common meeting place in society embracing diverse, distinct cultures</li>
<li>the experience of arrival and purposes of liberal education for refugee or recent immigrant</li>
<li>the possibility of a coherent program of liberal education in the absence of a common culture</li>
<li>liberal education as a progressive instrument in the face of hostility to migration, decolonization and cultural diversity</li>
<li>the aims of liberal education in a multi-cultural society</li>
<li>the idea of openness and Liberal Education</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Intersectionality of the refugees and the indigenous communities</li>
<li>International refugee law and the overlap with liberal education</li>
<li>the curriculum of liberal education: which are the great books; or is liberal education dependent on canonical texts, whatever they may be</li>
<li>Decolonization and canonization</li>
<li>pedagogical practice in the presence of cultural diversity — the problems “language proficiency,” cultural capital, and behavioral norms in the classroom</li>
<li>contending cultural norms and the possibility of a general, liberal education</li>
<li>should liberal education be an instrument of social and cultural integration?</li>
<li>trauma, memory and identity formation and how liberal education might address the issues</li>
<li>liberal education and the building of intercultural solidarity</li>
<li>immigration and the infusion; inspiration; and transformation of liberal education</li>
</ul>

			<title>[ June 1, 2023 -  June 2, 2023] Conference or similar: Critical phenomenology of the we</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106817</link>
						<description>Venue: 23.0.49<br/><br/><p>Classical phenomenology offers not only incisive analyses of intentionality, experience, selfhood, empathy and interpersonal understanding, but also quite sophisticated investigations of collective intentionality, affective sharing, social participation, communal experience, and group-identity. Indeed, while starting out with an interest in the individual mind, phenomenologists began exploring dyadic forms of interpersonal relations shortly before the start of World War I, and were deeply engaged in extensive analyses of communal forms of intentionality during the interwar period – at a time when nationalism was on the rise.</p>
<p>Today, the "We" has not lost its place in philosophical, political, or popular discourse. Within the last decade especially, we have witnessed renewed interest in the early phenomenological reflections on group formations, communal experiences, empathy, and fellow-feeling. Does this renewed interest suggest a need to revise our understandings of the "We", or does it attest to its enduring philosophical, social, and political significance/relevance? How have, for instance, perspectives from critical theory and feminist philosophy provided insights into the importance and limitations of questions of belonging, We-experiences, and We-identities? The aim of the current conference is to investigate how this recent critical turn in phenomenology might support, challenge, extend or qualify the classical phenomenological analyses.</p>
<p>Speakers include Alia Al-Saji, Linda Alcoff, Robert Bernasconi, Lisa Guenther, Sara Heinämaa, Steffen Hermann, Sophie Loidolt, Johanna Oksala, Michael Staudigl and Dan Zahavi.</p>

Confirmed speakers <strong>Mariano Delgado</strong> and <strong>Paola Uparela</strong> will present new research seeking to understand Las Casas as a transatlantic “reformer.”</p><p>Charles Taylor’s provocative study, <em>A Secular Age</em>, identifies Reform as a broad conviction “felt with increasing power during the Middle Ages and early modern period, that not just an élite, but as far as possible all the faithful live up to the demands of the Gospel” (104). In line with this theme, organizers welcome proposals that put Las Casas in conversation with broader trends in sixteenth-century European expansionism, reformations, Christian humanism, secularization, theology, print culture, and law. Engagements stemming from post-colonial theory, literary studies, philosophy, anthropology, and other critical disciplines are also welcome.</p><p>Importantly, this conference calls attention to Las Casas’s entrance into a self-consciously reforming Dominican Order, itself an expression of trends in the renewal of religious life. Participants will benefit from and contribute to the rich combination of unique research interests afforded by this interdisciplinary invitation to consider Las Casas as a reformer in his own right. <strong>Proposals</strong> (in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish) of <strong>250 to 500 words</strong> in length and a <strong>short bio of 250 words</strong> are due by <strong>February 1, 2023</strong>: sent to <a href="mailto:submissions@lascasianstudies.org?subject=Conference%202023">submissions@lascasianstudies.org with “Conference 2023” as the subject</a>. The conference will be held in Spanish and English.</p><p>Accepted proposals will be invited to submit a written version of their presentations for consideration to be included in a projected <a href="https://brill.com/view/title/38269" rel="nofollow">third double-blind peer-reviewed collection</a>.

						<description>Publication Name: The British Society for the Philosophy of Religion, Biennial Conference: Love, Religion, and God<br/><br/><p><strong>Keynote Speakers:</strong></p>
<p>Fiona Ellis (University of Roehampton)</p>
<p>Talbot Brewer (University of Virginia)</p>
<p>Judith Wolfe (University of St Andrews)</p>
<p>Paul Fiddes (University of Oxford)</p>
<p>The question of the relation between love, religion, and God is a central concern for both atheists and theists; and philosophers, theologians, and scientists have drawn interesting and sometimes conflicting conclusions about the nature of this relation and of the things related in this context. Can love be understood in the absence of God? Is love one thing or many things? And what is the relation between love and desire, or love and redemption? How are we to assess Nietzsche’s critique of Christian love? What is the role and value of love in non-theistic religious traditions? And in what sense, if any, should we accept that love is deeply mysterious?</p>
<p>These questions are attracting attention in recent scholarship, and the conference organisers are keen to examine the relevant issues from the vantage point of philosophy of religion as broadly conceived. We welcome papers taking a philosophical and/or theological approach to all aspects of love, religion, and God, including secular and diverse religious perspectives. We also encourage submissions from scholars who seek to make connections with other disciplines, such as religious studies, psychology, literature, and cognitive science. Members of under-represented groups are particularly encouraged to submit an abstract.</p>
<p>Those interested in presenting a short paper should send a proposal of no more than 250 words in a Word document to Dr David Worsley (david.worsley@york.ac.uk)<strong> no later than 31 March 2023.</strong> Please include the paper's title, and your name, institutional affiliation, and email address (these are not included in the 250 word word limit). We expect to notify people about whether their proposals have been accepted by 30 April 2023.</p>
<p>Some partial bursaries (including bursaries to cover the cost of childcare) may be available for participants who do not have another source of funding for attending the conference, with preference for these given to those who are presenting a paper. If you anticipate being in need of a bursary, please indicate this in your submission.</p>
<p>Conference registration closes on 13 August. Registration can be done via Eventbrite, here: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-bsprs-fifteenth-conference-love-religion-and-god-tickets-507654677807</p></description>

This year’s conversation will be centered around our conference theme:</p><p><strong><em>Haunted (by) Speech: Translating Religions and Religious Translations</em></strong></p><p><em>“What is it, then, to translate? Deep language learning of the original, straining to be haunted by it so it can be learned before reason.” — Gayatri Spivak</em></p><p>TTC 2023 is inspired by previous colloquia (Planetary Loves in 2007; Decolonizing Epistemologies in 2008; Life Under the Baobab Tree in 2017; and Trans: Human/Divine Bodies Beyond Boundaries in 2018). However, while these conferences considered the importance of “translation” in relation to postcolonial and decolonial theory, Africana studies, and gender and trans studies, this conference narrows its focus quite specifically on the problematic of “translation” itself. Indeed, we ask what is lost, but also what is gained in the act of translating religion.</p><p>Our starting point is translation theory and studies, the rich and vibrant field that takes into account questions of coloniality, cultural fluency, linguistic equivalence, and accented speech. To think about translation opens up the question of being haunted, possessed by, even surrendering to language and all of the cultural, political, and religious implications found within it. But, this process is one that is marked by risk, as the very act of translation prompts us to consider the enacting of wounds, the losses that manifest in the process. We acknowledge that the very form of this conference participates in monolingualism (namely, a particular form of English) in a U.S. based university, and thus, it is marked by the risk of another symbolic violence of translation in the transnational imbalance of power. We call attention to such limitations in hopes of generating a more thoughtful debate on these important issues. We hope this self-reflective awareness will be a consideration for participants.</p><p>In addition, we do not seek to remain solely within the realm of words and language. We also want to see what happens when “translation” moves into other registers, religious and interreligious registers that require us to think about the translation of beliefs, feelings, and thoughts into action or practice. We also turn to the problem of translation to consider what might not be translatable. Where might the procedures of equivalence and comparison become hegemonic practices that do not enact an appeal to “planetarity” but instead to power and control? As such, this conference seeks to consider how practices, ethics, and aesthetics of untranslatability might reroute or even upend such controlling grammars.</p><p>TTC invites papers from graduate students that explore the many dimensions of translation: its politics, methods, figures, concepts, and future directions, especially as these relate to the domain of religion. This year’s conference will be hybrid in its modality, and as such, we eagerly encourage submissions from those individuals who will present via Zoom as well as those who will be present on campus.</p><p>Proposals should be 200-300 words in length and include, as an attachment, a CV or brief bio that indicates the applicant’s institution, program, stage of completion, and area of focus/research interests. We welcome proposals for transdisciplinary papers as well as proposals for teaching sessions, activist engagement, art, or storytelling, and other creative approaches to engage the conference theme. <strong>Please submit your proposal to <a href="mailto:ttc@drew.edu">ttc@drew.edu</a> by January 15th in order to be considered.</strong> If accepted, presentations should be approximately 20 minutes in length (1,800-2,000 words).</p><p>Below are a few ideas of the kinds of conversations we are interested in having:</p><ul><li>The politics and aesthetics of translation</li><li>The figure of the “translator” or “interpreter” within religious, theological, and biblical studies</li><li>Community interpretation or the “community of interpreters”</li><li>Critical methods and methodologies for translation</li><li>Translating the category of “religion” across contexts (geographical, temporal, political, religious, etc.)</li><li>Symbols, symbolism, and symbolic languages</li><li>Untranslatable religious concepts or words</li><li>Translating thoughts, feelings, affects, or beliefs into action</li><li>The ineffable or ineffability</li><li>Poetics or theopoetics</li><li>Productive or inhibiting misinterpretations/mistranslations</li><li>The gift of tongues or speaking in tongues (glossolalia)</li></ul></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ttc@drew.edu">ttc@drew.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://drew.edu/theological-school/academics/doctor-of-philosophy/transdisciplinary-theological-colloquium/" target="_blank">https://drew.edu/theological-school/academics/doctor-of-philosophy/transdisciplinary-theological-colloquium/</a></div></div></div></description>

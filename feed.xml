<p align="center"><strong>Greeks in the Archaic Age: Institutions, Interactions, Traditions</strong></p>
<p>Τ Ε Κ Μ Η Ρ Ι Α, 1 is a Study Meeting born from the desire of young researchers, associated to the Chair of Greek History of the Department of Humanistic Studies of the University of Salerno (DipSum – Unisa) and coming from <em>Curriculum</em> 1 of the RAMUS Doctoral Program, to create a space for exchange, dialogue, and discussion in the wake of interdisciplinarity. Before included for three years in the Series hitherto called <em>Seminari dei Giovanissimi </em>– as part of the <em>Seminari Salernitani di Storia e Storiografia Greca </em>-, the initiative now takes on an autonomous name and dedicates its first new meeting to the memory of Clara Talamo, who recently passed away. For this reason, the Call proposes the development of themes to which the Scholar was particularly sensitive, and which have connoted the research directions of the Chair. The subject of Τ Ε Κ Μ Η Ρ Ι Α, 1 will therefore be <em>Greeks in the Archaic Age: Institutions, Interactions, Traditions.</em></p>
<p>The topics of the proposals may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Archaic institutions of the </em>poleis<em> in the Greek Mediterranean</em></li>
<li><em>Archaic aristocracies and their traditions</em></li>
<li><em>Religiosity and cultic practices in the archaic Greek world</em></li>
<li><em>History and monumentalization in the archaic age</em></li>
<li><em>Relationships among the components of the </em>polis <em>and elaborations on them</em></li>
<li><em>Evolutions in forms of government and their historiographical reception</em></li>
<li><em>Archaic institutions in political and philosophical reflection </em></li>
<li><em>Greeks and forms of interaction in the Mediterranean: traditions and material culture</em></li>
<li><em>Aspects and phenomena of colonial societies in the Archaic age: history, archaeology, historiography from East to West</em></li>
<li><em>Greeks and non-Greeks in land of migration and colony</em></li>
<li><em>Archaic Greekness in the history of European studies</em></li>
<li><em>Compared methodologies and research approaches on the subject</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Conference will be held, on <strong>October 10, 11, 12, 2023</strong>, in hybrid mode: in presence in the ‘Sala Conferenze del Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici’(building D3, third floor) of the University of Salerno (via Giovanni Paolo II,132, 84084 Fisciano), remotely on the Microsoft Teams platform at the link <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Aq_ci3pflhBSpQJJKB31-G6qjrJltgWof3eArxZFH5Uk1%40thread.tacv2/Generale?groupId=c121b357-4af3-42c1-af87-170e825bc953&amp;tenantId=c30767db-3dda-4dd4-8a4d-097d22cb99d3">https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aq_ci3pflhBSpQJJKB31-G6qjrJltgWof3eArxZFH5Uk1%40thread.tacv2/Generale?groupId=c121b357-4af3-42c1-af87-170e825bc953&amp;tenantId=c30767db-3dda-4dd4-8a4d-097d22cb99d3</a>.</p>

			<title>[ October 26, 2023 -  October 28, 2023] Conference or similar: Between Substance and Subject. The Presence of Spinoza in Hegel</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/109577</link>
						<description>Venue: Aškerčeva cesta 2<br/><br/><p>In the Lectures on the History of Philosophy Hegel notes that Spinoza confronts us with the fundamental alternative: Either Spinozism or no philosophy. In the Science of Logic, he affirms that the only possible refutation of Spinozism consists in first acknowledging its standpoint as essential and necessary and then raising it to a higher level out of its own resources. In philosophy one is accordingly bound to begin as a Spinozist, but it is of equal importance not to remain one. Even Hegel’s programmatic declaration in the Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit that in his view the true must be comprehended not merely as substance but also as subject, may be read in a double reference to Spinoza: on the one hand, Hegel seems to put the task of philosophy in accepting Spinozist metaphysics and nonetheless in preserving the dimensions of freedom, beauty and life that is usually associated with subjectivity, which Spinozism is supposed to lack; according to the methodological reading, on the other hand, Hegel may be said to call for developing a new conceptual regime that would supersede the mechanistic logic of understanding, exemplified by Spinoza’s mos geometricus, into a truly Hegelian logic of reason. Hegel’s entire philosophical system can thus be understood as a prolonged argument with Spinoza that raised to prominence with the Pantheism Controversy. What is more, not only there was a time when Hegel himself defended metaphysics of one substance, it may be argued that he eventually distanced himself from Spinozist metaphysics under the influence of Spinoza’s own political philosophy. The question is, of course, to what extent Hegel’s understanding of Spinoza was correct (for instance, omnis determinatio negatio, the concept of infinity) and to what extent he read it through Jacobi or Schelling. But it is obvious that, in most various forms, Spinoza is present throughout his philosophy, be it as the ideal to match or the adversary to beat. The aim of the conference is to explore this multifaceted presence of Spinoza in Hegel. We welcome papers on any aspect of the topic and stimulate fruitful exchange between established scholars, junior researchers, and PhD students</p></description>

			<title>[ May 21, 2023 -  May 22, 2023] Conference or similar: The Conference “In Search of a Hidden Phenomenology”</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/109541</link>
						<description>Venue: Kanonicza 9<br/><br/><p>The Department of the History of Philosophy of the Pontifical University in Kraków is pleased to invite you to The Second Conference “In Search of a Hidden Phenomenology”. The conference will focus on the variety of phenomenological methods and their application in various fields of research. The conference will be held on May 22-23, 2023 in the Senate Room (no. 200) at 9 Kanonicza Street.</p>
<p>“I” and the Other, the world of nature and the world of values, the sacred and God represent only some of the phenomena that the method initiated by Husserl and developed and modified by numerous phenomenologists sought to describe. It strove at its origins to grasp the essence of what transpires, while rejecting earlier presuppositions, theories, and speculations. But is the application of the presuppositionless method still possible in today's world dominated by scientism, and does the obvious ensure the true? Isn't the phenomenology today a method that is receding into the background of other philosophical trends, or is it itself concealed under the veil of scientificness derived from empiricism and positivism? The answers to these questions will be explored in the fields of philosophy, psychology, sociology, medicine, art and literature, and theology. Students, doctoral students, and academics are invited to contribute to this search. We will discuss not only the original understanding of phenomenology as a method and its subsequent development, but also the possibilities of its application today.</p>

			<title>[ May 25, 2023 -  May 26, 2023] Conference or similar: Postsecular Studies, Literature, and Care</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/109513</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The role of religion in culture and society has become an urgent question in today’s society. In a context of global escalation of politico-religious conflicts and revision of concepts which shed new light onto the allegedly secular modern thought, the tension between religion and (post)secular society must be framed within a multidisciplinary perspective.</p>
<p>Coined in 2001 by Jürgen Habermas to refer to the reconsideration of the role of religion in modern industrial societies, the term “postsecular” reflects the rebirth of debates on the religious phenomenon in different areas of the humanities. Far from being dismissed as a relic of a distant past, religion has become a key concept since the late twentieth century, triggering a veritable “religious turn” in philosophy (in Charles Taylor, Jacques Derrida, Jean Luc Marion, Julia Kristeva or Jean-Luc Nancy), a renewed interest in the history of secularization (in Foucaultian anthropologists such as Talal Asad, Saba Mahmood or Tomoko Masuzawa), the reemergence of critical political theology (in Alain Badiou, Carl Schmitt, Claude Lefort and Giorgio Agamben), the fusion of feminist, ecocritical and postsecular perspectives (in Rossi Braidotti and Michael Hardt), as well as the appearance of numerous studies on the relationship of religion and literature (in Mark Knight and Lori Branch).</p>
<p>The conference “Postsecular Studies, Literature, and Care” pays attention to these current phenomena from two emerging lines or research or turns which have had a deep impact on literary studies in recent years: the “postsecular turn” and the “political turn”. These turns are on the one hand a response to several historical developments—from 9/11 to the coexistence of different though migration—which have caused Western, allegedly secular societies to rethink the role of religion in today’s world. On the other hand, the genealogical analyses of Michel Foucault have uncovered, from the perspective of the history of Western thought, the religious origins of secular modernity’s conceptual framework, and have brought attention to the exhaustion of modernity in the face of the challenges posed by capitalism as the “crisis of great narratives”.</p>
<p>This diverse and multidisciplinary approach to postsecularism entails—as was the case with other concepts such as “postcolonialism” or “postmodernism”—a certain ambivalence and polysemy. In recent years, the postsecular has tended to be considered not as a chronological category following a period of secularization in modernity but rather as a critical stance and as category of analysis capable of gauging the tensions between the religious and the secular. In short, the postsecular has been defined as an epistemic perspective which observes that the religious and the secular have been inextricably connected since modernity. The present conference shall endeavor to develop a notion of the postsecular as a way of paying attention to the relationship between religious and political power, new political theologies, the historical construction of religion and the secular, as well as the emergence of new spiritualities in (post)industrial societies.</p>
<p>From this vantage point, the present conference acknowledges the inherent pluralism of the postsecular and sets out to study its ambivalence and polysemy from a plural perspective which pays attention to its several dimensions, from philology and history, to philosophy and the critical analysis of the present era. In addition, the politics of literature as proposed by Jacques Rancière and Michel Foucault, is one of the main avenues of analysis of the postsecular.</p>
<p>Please submit a short 150-word of your proposed paper topic (in Spanish, English, German or French) including five keywords to <a href="mailto:aalias@ugr.es">antonioalias@ugr.es</a>; <a href="mailto:tespino@ugr.es">tespino@ugr.es</a> by April 15th, 2023.</p>

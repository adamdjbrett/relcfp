						<description>Publication Name: Phenomenology and the Sciences<br/><br/><p>Call for Papers: Phenomenology and the Sciences: Between Foundation, Clarification, and Material Contributions. <em>Studia Phaenomenologica</em> XXIV (2024)</p>
<p>Guest Editors: Andrea Altobrando and Simone Aurora</p>
<p>EXTENDED DEADLINE: 1 September 2023.</p>
<p>What can phenomenology say nowadays concerning the sciences? Is phenomenology able to provide the ground stone Husserl dreamt of, or, as he himself says in the <em>Crisis</em>, “der Traum ist ausgeträumt”? If this is the case, what is the position that phenomenology can assume towards sciences? Can phenomenology itself be considered as a specific science? Can phenomenology offer any contribution to scientific research, both basic and applied? Should phenomenology be understood as a kind of epistemology? Or is there a specific field of research that pertains specifically to phenomenology and that is not on a pair with epistemological reflection?</p>
<p>From its very beginning, phenomenology has shown a strong connection with scientific thought and the sciences. Husserl’s (more or less orthodox) followers, and, more generally, scientist and philosophers, who have found some kind of inspiration in Husserl’s phenomenological project, have variously tried to implement the idea, according to which phenomenology should prepare the ground, clarify the basic concepts and practices, as well as the relationships between different scientific disciplines. Just to mention some, think of Alfred Schutz for sociology, Hermann Weyl for Physics, Oskar Becker for mathematics and geometry, Ludwig Binswanger and Erwin Straus for psychopathology, Roman Jakobson for linguistics, Aron Gurwitsch for psychology. During the past decades, phenomenological researches have especially been carried out in collaboration with, or within the field, of cognitive sciences, the psy-sciences, and the neurosciences. The foundational task of phenomenology has only seldom been at the center of these researches, though. More recently, phenomenology has been seen as offering important insights and contributions to questions and investigations pertaining physics, as well as a potentially powerful tool to tackle classical epistemological questions, and questions concerning philosophy of science, thus finally opening a new bridge between phenomenology and analytic philosophy beyond the restricted field of philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>All in all, phenomenology is nowadays active in two ways towards the sciences, somehow confirming its hybrid position: on the one hand, phenomenology has a clarificatory task, that is concurrently foundational one; on the other hand, phenomenology is practiced in order to offer insights and, more generally, contributions that allow enlarging knowledge within specific sciences.</p>
<p>The 2024 issue of <em>Studia Phaenomenologica</em> will be devoted to the aforementioned and related questions. We invite scholars to submit contributions that tackle the following issues, and strictly related ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>phenomenological clarification of the concept of science and non-science</li>
<li>phenomenological foundations of specific scientific disciplines</li>
<li>phenomenological contributions to scientific knowledge</li>
<li>phenomenology and epistemology</li>
<li>cases of knowledge transfer between phenomenology and specific scientific disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission Guidelines: https://zetabooks.com/library/journals/studia-phaenomenologica/</p>
<p>The papers should be sent to: submissions@phenomenology.ro (subject title: <em>Studia Phaenomenologica </em>2024)</p></description>

The purpose of these symposiums is to redefine the place of the Ottoman tradition in both the overall scheme of the Islamic sciences and the history of thought in general, in order to contribute to the growing literature on these sciences within Ottoman society. In this context, eight symposiums have been organized so far, focusing on the disciplines of philosophical theology (<em>kalām</em>), jurisprudence (<em>fiqḥ</em>), sufism (<em>taṣawwuf</em>), quranic exegesis (<em>tafsīr</em>), prophetic traditions (<em>ḥadīth</em>), Arabic linguistic sciences (<em>al-ʿulūm al-ʿarabiyya</em>), logic and argumentation theory (<em>man</em><em>ṭ</em><em>iq</em> and <em>munāẓara</em>), and historiography. The output of each symposium has been published as an edited book. The ninth of these symposiums will be about ethics (<em>ʿilm al-akhlāq</em>) in the Ottoman period.</p><p>Ethics as a discipline in the history of Islamic thought, as in other civilizations, relates to the examination of the origin of our behavior which is subject to the predicates of good and bad, the criteria for good and bad, the faculties that occur in the human soul or mind and are accepted as virtue or vice, and virtues and vices that different classes of people need to obtain or refrain from. From the 13th century onward, the field of ethics transformed into a corpus which covers economics and politics, and has dealt with political, economic, and cultural relations beyond individual life. It has also been effective in the development of different perspectives and various understandings of the human being. Considering the long history of the basin of civilization established by Islam, it is clear that contemplation on ethics, which has various stages and forms of expression, is a suitable research area.</p><p>The Ottoman period is privy to a long and rich heritage in which the conceptual repertoire and discussions of the old heritage are kept alive thanks to copied works. On the other hand, intellectual production continued and solutions were offered to social and political problems through original texts, commentaries, and translations. Ottoman writings on ethics , which became evident in the 15th century, acquired its own original qualities in addition to encompassing the heritage of its predecessors. Led by such names as Cemaleddin Aksarayī, Ahmed al-Amāsī, Sinan Pasha, and Kāsım Karahisari,  the venture of Ottoman writings on ethics continued with such scholars as: Idris-i Bitlis, Taşköprülüzāde, Kınalızāde, Pir Muhammed, Celālzāde Mustafa Çelebi, Gelibolulu Āli, Muhyi-i Gülşenī, and Müneccimbaşı Ahmed Dede. It has reached modern times with the works of intellectual and artistic connoisseurs like Yağıkçızâde Mehmet Arif, Ali Seydi, and Ömer Ferit Kam.</p><p>Despite being a vast research area, the Ottoman period, which reflects the contemplation on ethics in Islam with all its richness and originality, has still not been the subject of sufficient examination. In this context, the symposium <em>Ethics in the Ottoman Period</em> will focus on the scholars who dealt with ethics, works on the subject, and problems of the period. The symposium aims to illuminate the works, sources, methods, tendencies, aims, and theories of individual scholars who dealt with ethics on one hand, and to illuminate the principles, various aspects, and stages of the contemplation on ethics in the Ottoman Empire on the other. A holistic evaluation of all these, together with both their theoretical extensions and their application areas throughout history, can only be possible with an interdisciplinary effort that encompasses such sciences as history, jurisprudence, literature, Sufism, theology, philosophy, and medicine.</p><p> </p><p><strong>While not limiting, the titles of the symposium include the following sample themes:</strong></p><p>The scope and main milestones of ethical thought in the Ottoman period</p><p>Possible classifications (chronological, regional, religious, ethnolinguistic, vocational, subject-based, etc.) for ethical texts and authors in the Ottoman period</p><p>Ottoman thinkers' expectancy from ethics and the way they posited this science</p><p>The place of ethics in the classification of sciences</p><p>The relationship of ethics with the other disciplines, such as history, jurisprudence, politics, economics, literature, and Sufism</p><p>Sources used in Ottoman ethical works</p><p>Authoring motivations of Ottoman ethical thinkers and their intellectual traditions</p><p>Types of authoring of ethical works of the Ottoman period</p><p>Translation activities in the context of Ottoman ethical though</p><p> </p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>After the program, the authors will be given time for the selected papers to be arranged as book chapters and the texts will be published as part of a separate edited book.</p><p>The languages of the symposium to be held in Istanbul are Turkish, Arabic, and English.</p><p>Travel and accommodation expenses of accepted notifiers will be covered.</p><p>Abstracts should be arranged no more than 250 words.</p><p>Abstracts should be sent to <a href="mailto:symposium@isar.org.tr">symposium@isar.org.tr</a> along with the applicants' contact information and academic CVs.</p></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.isar.org.tr/en/symposiums-workshops/ethics-in-the-ottoman-period/call-for-papers-13" target="_blank">https://www.isar.org.tr/en/symposiums-workshops/ethics-in-the-ottoman-period/call-for-papers-13</a></div></div></div></description>

			<title>[ June 22, 2023] Talk or similar: Kant on the Dilemma of Rational Religion</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/112050</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Richard Velkley (Tulane University)<br/><br/><p><strong>Abstract<br/><br/></strong>Kant’s critical philosophy offers a limited defense of religion in the form of pure rational religion based on rational autonomy. Such religion contains an internal difficulty in that morality as autonomy inevitably leads to religion as hope for the achievement of a moral world that finite humans strive to realize but know they cannot bring about wholly through human powers. Humans are, therefore, inevitably drawn to forms of deliverance from evil granted through higher powers as taught by historical religions. But such deliverance weakens or even opposes autonomous human efforts at improvement. In Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason, Kant argues that pure rational religion needs to draw support from historical religion, specifically Christianity, but must oppose the salvific claims of such religion. These requirements lead to Kant’s remarkable doctrine about radical evil, the propensity of human reason to place self-love above the demands of the moral law. According to this doctrine, the believer must regard the evil inherent in the human disposition as inextirpable and must also commit to unending progress in opposing evil. One could call this the dilemma of teleology in rational religion.</p></description>

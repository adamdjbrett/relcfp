Nevertheless, in recent decades, scholars have advanced a more nuanced understanding of this relationship, depending on which particular aspects are being considered.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>For instance, when considering religion as a practice, one discovers that religious institutions and individuals have used a wide range of technologies since ancient times, including printing and writing to preserve teachings, time-measurement devices and astronomical knowledge to determine the correct ritual time, and, of course, complex ritual actions to attract followers and engage natural and supernatural forces.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>These precedents illustrate the complexity of the relationship between religion and technology, a relationship which encompasses not just technology in its material sense, but techniques such as knowledge organization and the specific methods needed to achieve particular ends. In addition to the way in which technology affects religious practices, their spread, and religious dialogue, new technology underlying communications and the social and digital spheres facilitates the systematization of religious data, making religions more accessible to academic study than ever before.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Thus, what we can state about the relationship of religion and technology is not their separation or antagonism but their entanglement, which calls us to take into account how technology and religion have co-evolved in the past, consider which are the critical engagements of religion with technology today, and imagine how they could develop in the future. Considering all of the above, the theme of this year’s EASR conference encourages participants to present and discuss any aspect relating to religion and technology in the broadest sense, e.g.</span></span></span></span></p><ol><li>The concepts and connotations of technology across various religions.</li><li>Discussing how religions have viewed and treated technology historically and more recently.</li><li>The relationship between religion as practice and theory, or religion and science, including their interactions, conflicts, or other types of interactions.</li><li>Investigating esoteric, magical, or other religious practices as techniques.</li><li>Reflecting the spread and practice of religion via technology. The ways in which religions invent, adopt, and adapt technological innovations, including communication technologies and new media.</li><li>Understanding religion through the lens of concepts associated with social technologies, technological knowledge, etc.</li><li>The use of technologies and techniques in religious studies. Studying religion in the digital age: advances in the digital humanities and beyond. The ways in which existing technologies and their notions influence the study of religion.</li></ol><p><br/><span><span><span><b><span>Important Dates</span></b></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><b><span>Call for Session Proposal</span></b><span> (open and closed panels):<br/>October 1, 2022 – November 15, 2022</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>More details about the conference and paper submission can be found here and in information below: <a href="https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-panels/" rel="nofollow"><span>https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-panels/</span></a></span></span></span></span></span><br/><span><span><span><span><b>Notification of Acceptance of Panels:</b><br/>until November 25, 2022<br/><b>Call for Individual Papers</b><br/>December 1, 2022 - January 31, 2023<br/><b>Notification of Acceptance of Individual Papers</b><br/>February 28, 2023<br/><b>Registration</b></span><br/><u><span><span>Early bird registration</span></span></u><span><span>: until May 31, 2023</span></span><br/><u><span>Standard registration</span></u><span>: until June 30, 2023<span> (Deadline for presenting authors)</span><br/><u>Late registration &amp; on site</u> (non presenting participants): from July 1, 2023</span></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><h3>Contact Conference Secretariat</h3><div><p>Conference and Events Agency “Seven Tips”<br/>Legal name: UAB Kalanis<br/>Rūdninkų str. 18, Vilnius<br/><a href="mailto:conference@seventips.lt">conference@seventips.lt</a><br/>+370 682 28647</p></div></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:conference@seventips.lt">conference@seventips.lt</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-panels/" target="_blank">https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-panels/</a></div></div></div></description>

			<title>[ July 3, 2023 -  July 12, 2023] Conference or similar: 15th International Deleuze and Guattari Studies Conference and Camp 2023</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/104973</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The 2023 Deleuze and Guattari Studies Conference and Camp in Belgrade, Serbia will be the first time this international event takes place in the Balkans!</p>
<p>The Conference and Camp have a long and rich history. The event first took place in 2008 at Cardiff University, Wales (then known as International Deleuze Studies Conference). Since then, the Conference and Camp visited numerous places around the world, including countries in Europe, the Latin America, as well as the US and Canada. There are also editions of the Conference and Camp in Asia and India. Its strong interdisciplinary profile gathers experts, researches, artists and students to discus and exchange ideas, as well as generate new insights in the field of Deleuze and Guattari studies.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Conference and Camp have been associated with the Deleuze and Guattari Studies journal. There is also a strong academic community gathered around the journal and the Conference and Camp event in the Deleuze and Guattari Facebook group.</p>
<p>Like the Conference, the journal strives toward an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to the works of Deleuze and Guattari. The journal invites philosophical, literary, cultural, historical and many other approaches to diverse topics that draw their inspiration from Deleuze and Guattari’s body of work. In this way, the Conference and Camp, as well as the journal, remain true to the spirit of Deleuze and Guattari’s legacy that always resisted traditional categorization.</p></description>

						<description><p>The 2023 Deleuze and Guattari Studies Conference and Camp in Belgrade, Serbia will be the first time this international event takes place in the Balkans.</p>
<p>The Conference and Camp have a long and rich history. The event first took place in 2008 at Cardiff University, Wales (then known as International Deleuze Studies Conference). Since then, the Conference and Camp visited numerous places around the world, including countries in Europe, the Latin America, as well as the US and Canada. There are also editions of the Conference and Camp in Asia and India. Its strong interdisciplinary profile gathers experts, researches, artists and students to discus and exchange ideas, as well as generate new insights in the field of Deleuze and Guattari studies.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Papers - Space, Control, Resistance</strong></p>
<p>‘Control’ is the name which in 1990 Deleuze gave to the ‘new monster’ that is now our present. He said then, and it resonates still, that the most important question of our time is where and how we will find ‘new forms of resistance’.</p>
<p>The old societies of discipline, which Deleuze saw as the predecessor to those of control, operated through spaces of confinement and enclosure. Their crisis gave way to a different type of spatial organization of power: instead of discreet enclosures, we find ourselves in open spaces and within a continuous network. The subject of control is not the molded body in confinement anymore, but a faceless sample, a crowd in constant modulation.</p>
<p>The enclosed and isolated body of the prison has given way to bodies in ‘open prisons’ of connected programs, binary digital systems and their many tools – resulting in a nomadic psyche that carries the panopticon with(in) itself. Like the <em>watchwords</em> of the discipline society, control operates with <em>passwords</em> that regulate space through access/rejection to various types of flows, such as money, information, knowledge, or art.</p>
<p>However, like disciplinary societies, spaces of control offer their own avenues for resistance.  Resistance is never simply a reactive force. Indeed, as Deleuze and Guattari remind us, ‘resistance comes first’. The concepts of line of flight, war machine, micropolitics, deterritorialization, rhizome, becoming-minoritian, or becoming-woman, testify to the importance of thinking resistance in terms of an active force. This thought of the outside is more pertinent now than ever, because as Deleuze once protested, ‘resistance to the present’ is what we lack the most.</p>
<p>Whether one works in architecture, music or cinema, philosophy, art or science, politics, economics or literature, ecology and geography, entertainment, medicine and sport, or issues of race, gender, and sexuality, the question is the same: what is the nature of the form of power we are exposed to today and where can we find real potential for change? How can we think and construct spaces that would act as areas of resistance against the oppressive strategies of control?</p>
<p>The conference aims to show how an engagement with the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari contributes to the project of discovering emancipatory dimensions of space. We welcome explorations of the way philosophy, art, or science create spaces that allow escape and counterattacks? In what way can music, art, or travel act as areas that would not be re-captured by the contemporary network of control? How can internet phenomena, such as piracy or viruses, assist us in scrambling the digital flows of controlled data? Are there perhaps creative potentials even in history, where archaisms would not only feed the mechanisms of control, but also provide avenues for chaosmotic becomings? Or are there arts of control, as Deleuze once suggested, that could also function as forms of resistance?</p>
<p>By turning to these questions, we aspire to enrich the broad field of Deleuze and Guattari studies with new and original insights: across in the disciplines of political and social theory, ethics and logic, psychoanalysis, Anthropocene studies, metaphysics and the theories of new materialisms, epistemology and aesthetics following the affective turn.</p>
<p>We invite paper and panel proposals from scholars of all disciplines, as well as performance and installation proposals from artists related to the theme of the Conference. We also kindly ask students interested in the Camp to send us their applications.</p>
<p>Deadline for submissions:<strong> January 22, 2023</strong></p>
<p>Notification of results:<strong> February 28, 2023</strong></p></description>

And if so, how the interactions between the religious and the secular produce new memory forms and content in the heterogenous societies of the present-day world?</p><p><em>The collective volume 'Memory and Religion from a Post-Secular Perspective', edited by Yuliya Yurchuk and Zuzanna Bogumił argues that religion is a system of significant meanings that have an impact on other systems and spheres of social life, including cultural memory.  The editors call for a postsecular turn in memory studies to provide a more reflective and meaningful approach to the constant interplay between the religious and the secular. This opens up new perspectives on the intersection of memory and religion and helps memory scholars become more aware of the religious roots of the language they are using in their studies of memory. The cases analysed demonstrate that religion has a significant impact on cultural memory, family memory, and the contemporary politics of history in secularized societies. At the same time, politics, grassroots movements, and different secular agents and processes have so much influence on the formation of memory by religious actors that even religious, ecclesiastic and confessional memories are affected by the secular</em>.</p><p>Join the seminar on Zoom: <a href="https://psu.zoom.us/j/96181831783?fbclid=IwAR3sxbMKlqT-7XVBRYJnWrySQbxdTzEnRZ5ht5JPSXdtxCLOJW44epi4ijU#success" rel="nofollow">link </a><br/>Learn more about the series: <a href="https://enrs.eu/project/ers-series%C2%A0" rel="nofollow">https://enrs.eu/project/ers-series </a></p></div></div></div></description>

This year’s conversation will be centered around our conference theme:</p><p><strong><em>Haunted (by) Speech: Translating Religions and Religious Translations</em></strong></p><p><em>“What is it, then, to translate? Deep language learning of the original, straining to be haunted by it so it can be learned before reason.” — Gayatri Spivak</em></p><p>TTC 2023 is inspired by previous colloquia (Planetary Loves in 2007; Decolonizing Epistemologies in 2008; Life Under the Baobab Tree in 2017; and Trans: Human/Divine Bodies Beyond Boundaries in 2018). However, while these conferences considered the importance of “translation” in relation to postcolonial and decolonial theory, Africana studies, and gender and trans studies, this conference narrows its focus quite specifically on the problematic of “translation” itself. Indeed, we ask what is lost, but also what is gained in the act of translating religion.</p><p>Our starting point is translation theory and studies, the rich and vibrant field that takes into account questions of coloniality, cultural fluency, linguistic equivalence, and accented speech. To think about translation opens up the question of being haunted, possessed by, even surrendering to language and all of the cultural, political, and religious implications found within it. But, this process is one that is marked by risk, as the very act of translation prompts us to consider the enacting of wounds, the losses that manifest in the process. We acknowledge that the very form of this conference participates in monolingualism (namely, a particular form of English) in a U.S. based university, and thus, it is marked by the risk of another symbolic violence of translation in the transnational imbalance of power. We call attention to such limitations in hopes of generating a more thoughtful debate on these important issues. We hope this self-reflective awareness will be a consideration for participants.</p><p>In addition, we do not seek to remain solely within the realm of words and language. We also want to see what happens when “translation” moves into other registers, religious and interreligious registers that require us to think about the translation of beliefs, feelings, and thoughts into action or practice. We also turn to the problem of translation to consider what might not be translatable. Where might the procedures of equivalence and comparison become hegemonic practices that do not enact an appeal to “planetarity” but instead to power and control? As such, this conference seeks to consider how practices, ethics, and aesthetics of untranslatability might reroute or even upend such controlling grammars.</p><p>TTC invites papers from graduate students that explore the many dimensions of translation: its politics, methods, figures, concepts, and future directions, especially as these relate to the domain of religion. This year’s conference will be hybrid in its modality, and as such, we eagerly encourage submissions from those individuals who will present via Zoom as well as those who will be present on campus.</p><p>Proposals should be 200-300 words in length and include, as an attachment, a CV or brief bio that indicates the applicant’s institution, program, stage of completion, and area of focus/research interests. We welcome proposals for transdisciplinary papers as well as proposals for teaching sessions, activist engagement, art, or storytelling, and other creative approaches to engage the conference theme. <strong>Please submit your proposal to <a href="mailto:ttc@drew.edu">ttc@drew.edu</a> by January 15th in order to be considered.</strong> If accepted, presentations should be approximately 20 minutes in length (1,800-2,000 words).</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ttc@drew.edu">ttc@drew.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://drew.edu/theological-school/academics/doctor-of-philosophy/transdisciplinary-theological-colloquium/" target="_blank">https://drew.edu/theological-school/academics/doctor-of-philosophy/transdisciplinary-theological-colloquium/</a></div></div></div></description>

We invite participants to consider how might Jewish studies as a field be positioned to interrogate time as a concept. This conference will be held <strong>February 2-3, 2023, online</strong> with an optional in-person reception and closing event.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to think through questions that relate to how contemporary studies of Jews, Judaisms, and Jewishness offer new perspectives or rescue old concepts in the understanding of time throughout history. How can Jewish studies illuminate questions about time? How do the societies, organizations, or figures we research deal with temporal problems? We welcome proposals that engage/discuss Judaisms, Jewishness, and time in myriad ways, such as memory, narrative, and mourning; history and historiography; modernity, coloniality, and the nation-state; indigeneity and deep time; calendars, materiality, monuments, and ritual; ecology and climate change; the experience of time and other phenomenological issues; messianism and prophecy; or other topics.</p><p>The conference is open to all graduate students working in Jewish studies and adjacent fields. As an interdisciplinary conference, we welcome papers from many fields, including but not limited to Religious Studies, Anthropology, Sociology, Music, Literature, Folklore, Film Studies, Visual and Performance Art, History, and Political Science. Also, we encourage the proposal of unconventional presentations, including visual, musical, and performance arts.</p><p>We are excited to announce that this year’s Lillian Solotkin Keynote Lecture, titled “Memory Citizenship: Migration and Holocaust Memory in Contemporary Germany,” will be given by Dr. Michael Rothberg, 1939 Society Samuel Goetz Chair in Holocaust Studies and Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Please send an abstract (maximum 300 words), a title for your presentation, and contact information, including name, email address, telephone number, and institution to <a href="mailto:jsgsacon@indiana.edu">jsgsacon@indiana.edu</a> by November 14.</strong> Abstracts will be evaluated based on quality and fit. Participants will be notified of acceptance by <strong>November 30</strong>. Papers will need to be submitted by January 9 for circulation among faculty respondents. Participants will have 20 minutes to present.</p><p>Please email questions to <strong><a href="mailto:jsgsacon@indiana.edu">jsgsacon@indiana.edu</a></strong>.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Sabina Ali<br/>Jewish Studies Graduate Student Association<br/>Borns Jewish Studies Program<br/>Indiana University, Bloomington</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:jsgsacon@indiana.edu">jsgsacon@indiana.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

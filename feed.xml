Unlike another response, namely comparative theology (which remains “confessional” or married to the truth of one’s starting or “home” religion), <em>theology without walls</em> is willing and eager to explore other religions—even non-religious sources—in what Jerry Martin calls “an effort to understand ultimate reality as fully as possible.”</p>
<p>Papers are invited for a special issue of <em>Socio-Historical Examination of Religion and Ministry</em> (SHERM Journal) on the claims, achievements, challenges, failings, and the very possibility or desirability of a theology without walls. Papers from any discipline, including theology, philosophy of religion, anthropology, cognitive science, etc., are welcome, as are papers written from the perspective of other faith traditions outside of Christianity. The submission date is open, but ideally collected papers would be delivered to the journal no later than Spring 2024.</p>

			<title>[ October 1, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: The Annual International Virtual Conference on the Dialogue between Science and Theology</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/114126</link>
						<description><p>The Annual International Virtual Conference on the Dialogue between Science and Theology</p>
<p>(DIALOGO-CONF 2023 IVCD)</p>
<p>Virtual attendance during November 3 - 13, 2023</p>
<p>#CFP: Invitation to submit papers on &gt; from a religious, spiritual, Scientific, or secular point of view.</p>
<p>https://www.dialogo-conf.com/call-for-papers/#2nd</p>
<p>The dialogue between science and religion is one of our time's most prominent and visible discourses. The complex but enduring relationship between the sciences and diverse world religions has now transformed into what some call a new scholarly field of science and religion. This multifaceted conversation has developed into a sustained and dynamic discourse with direct implications for contemporary culture. This discourse affects all religions in both their intellectual and social dimensions. It also analyzes, supports, and constrains the global impact of the sciences of our times.</p>
<p>  In light of the many challenges that the world is now facing, a broad understanding of modern science is indispensable in today's society so that we are both competitive in today's high-tech job market and well-informed on scientific matters. The methodology of modern science has been remarkably successful in uncovering the working of the Earth and universe for us. Just in the past half-century, science has unlocked the code of life and read the DNA of many organisms, traced the history of the known universe, and discovered a set of mathematical laws that explain, at a fundamental level, virtually all physical phenomena with remarkable precision. It is increasingly clear that any movement that opposes the progress of modern science is simply digging a pit for itself.</p>
<p>  On the other hand, religion plays a similarly necessary foundation in the lives of the vast majority of people worldwide. Religion has indisputably inspired some of the world's most outstanding art and literature, as it is evident even from a casual stroll through any of the World's great art museums. Even more importantly, religion has played an enormous role worldwide as a moral and ethical conduct governor through the ages.</p>
<p>15 Sections are available for a comprehensive coverage of the central theme: The dialogue between sciences and religions.</p>
<p>Earlybird Deadline for full-paper submission is from July 1st to August 30th.</p>
<p>Regular Deadline submission by October 1st</p>
<p>Author notification of acceptance by October 10th</p>
<p>Upon December 15, 2023, quick publishing on the Open Access Archive, https://www.dialogo-conf.com/archive/. Followed up by indexing in more than 20 Databases.</p>

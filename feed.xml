			<title>[ August 10, 2024 -  August 11, 2024] Conference or similar: Pausing Time/Timing the Pause: sayability in the arts, philosophy, and politics</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/121782</link>
						<description>Venue: ul. Ejsmonda 2<br/><br/><p><strong>Deadline for proposals: 1 June, 2024</strong></p>
<p>In his acceptance speech for the Nobel prize in literature Jon Fosse only half jokingly referred to himself as the master of silence: how else, he asked, can we bring the unsayable out in language than through “long pause, short pause, or, simply, pause.”<br/><br/>Key questions for this year’s Ereignis conference are:<br/><br/>* What kind of speech, or speech event, enables the silent to come forward? <br/>* How can that which cannot be said be alluded or referred to in speech?<br/>* How is the relation between speech and silence challenged by the an increasing awareness of non-human speech? <br/>* What are the socio-political ramifications of these relations?</p>

			<title>[ April 25, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Write with an-other\(m)/Other</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/121734</link>
						<description><p>Writing is a core activity for many academics, artists, thinkers, students… Yet how can we practise writing in a way that is not evolving around one – one author, one text, one Truth, one publication – which is a repetition of the same (Irigaray), a violence to the world (Levinas), and a phallic lack (Ettinger). During this week we invite collaborators who are interested in exploring an-other reality that can be writing. Not limited to linguistic practises. </p>
<p>with– Power is often understood along the lines of ‘power over’. But there is also a power-with. Heidegger talked about being in terms of a ‘being-with’. We would like to extend these distinctions towards the realm of art, and writing in particular. What does it mean to write-with. Is it possible? What are the prerequisites, what are the possible outcomes? We particularly invite experiments and failure. </p>
<p>An-other – Although the understanding that the individual’s identity and being relies on the relationality with the an-other/not-I is more and more acceptable in Western philosophy and the arts, it remains an ephemeral concept that is riddled with prejudices. How to create a space in which an-other is neither othered nor destroyed by colonisation of the I? And more prominently, how to do that within language, within a linearity of text? How to deal with archives that lack the other-as-other as they write within systems of exclusion? How to deal with a text that is not one’s own? How to deal with a text an-other-you has written yesterday? </p>
<p>\(m)/Other – And yet there is also the possibility of compassion, the raised arms of the (m)Other that does not know yet that all turn to for knowledge. The burden of proof is always shifted to those who already understand, whose knowledge is earned through generations and emotional work, and how to convey this to the Other that is never going to go through all of that? How is writing also a practise to be with one’s self, raising arms in desperation and in prayer, \(m)/, accessing something that lies between Truth and Life. </p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Invitation</p>
<p>This is an invitation for exploration around these themes. We especially encourage workshops / interactive formats. We have a whole week together, to write with an-other\(m)/Other. Also very welcome to participate without presenting / giving a workshop. First-time experiments are as welcome as tested concepts. </p>
<p>Please send us a short text explaining your aim / topic / idea, how much time you would need to host the experience, and what materials you would need (paper/paint/bicycles). </p>
<p>About Nordic Summer University (NSU):</p>

			<title>[ April 15, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: UCSIA Summer School: 'God on our side? Questioning Theological Narratives of Nationalism, Populism &amp; Conservatism'</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/121694</link>
						<description><p>The UCSIA Summer School is a free one-week mentoring programme that encourages doctoral and postdoctoral students to explore interdisciplinary ways of analysing the relationship between religion, culture and society. Key elements of the programme are expert lectures, paper presentations by the students and individual tutoring by the faculty. The UCSIA Summer School 2024, titled <em>God on Our Side? Questioning Theological Narratives of Nationalism, Populism and Conservatism</em>, marks the start of a three-year cycle of summer schools, focused on the entanglements of religion and politics, the communities in which they take shape and function, and the injustices they entail or critique.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, new forms of nationalism, populism and conservatism are emerging. They take shape at the intersection of historical, geopolitical, socio-economic as well as religious developments and discourses, with theological justifications of nationalist discourses playing an important role in the framing of national identities and the ‘Other’. An analysis of such ‘theological nationalism’ and religiously inspired politics is crucial to discerning the religious dimensions of contemporary politics and their global resonance.</p>
<p>Concepts of theological and political nature have always been reciprocally negotiated; their entangled histories have shaped and continue to shape communities and societies in practice, with diverging concrete effects. By bringing the different disciplines of the human sciences into dialogue with theology, this summer school will explore the dynamic exchange of concepts, ideas and assumptions between the theological and the political realm, that contribute to constructing a nationalist identity. Furthermore, attention will be paid to the racialization of religion, theological and religious nationalism, populism and conservatism and economic theologies. At the other end of the political spectrum, certain forms of socialism and solidarity are based on (secularized) religious or spiritual concepts such as ‘progress’, which – according to Karl Löwith – is the modern, secularized guise of the Christian theological concept of ‘hope’.</p>
<p>Doctoral and postdoctoral students with a research interest in religion are invited to apply to the summer school by submitting a research paper. Papers may address, but are not limited to the following questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is theological or religious nationalism?</li>
<li>What accounts for its rise in different parts of the world? What issues does it respond to?</li>
<li>How do we understand theologically and socially scientifically the operation of theological ideas outside the realm of their institutions?</li>
<li>How is theological and religious nationalism intertwined with political trends of populism and conservatism?</li>
<li>How can we distinguish nationalist, populist or conservative theological-political discourses?</li>
<li>How do different scientific disciplines interpret public and political theology in these contexts?</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on the programme and application procedure is available via www.ucsia-summerschool.org </p></description>

The latter are often subsumed under the rather problematic and open-ended rubric “Muslims.” This has resulted in numerous political and legal attempts to confront, categorise, and ultimately control internal Muslim communities, just as it has been used to keep external ones at bay. This Muslim Question, however, is often less about actual Muslims than it is about idealised and reified ones, what Professor Hughes calls “the ubiquitous Muslim,” someone who is imagined to threaten so-called Western values from within. In this lecture, Professor Hughes will address how this “ubiquitous Muslim” — everywhere yet nowhere, named but nameless, both unsettled and unsettling—subsequently aids in the recalibration of now politicised commitments to perceived founding ideals, such as liberty and equality.</p><p><strong>Speaker</strong></p><p><strong>Aaron Hughes</strong> is the Dean's Professor of the Humanities and Philip S. Bernstein Professor of Religion at the University of Rochester, USA. He is also Visiting Guest Professor at the Aga Khan University’s Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilisations (AKU-ISMC). Professor Hughes is the author of of numerous books on Islam and religion, including , most recently, An Anxious Inheritance Religious Others and the Shaping of Sunni Orthodoxy (Oxford University Press, 2022), From Seminary to University: An Institutional History of the Study of Religion in Canada (University of Toronto Press, 2020), Muslim and Jew: Origins, Growth, Resentment (Routledge, 2019), and Shared Identities: Medieval and Modern Imaginings of Judeo-Islam (Oxford University Press, 2017). For the 2022/23 academic year, he holds the Fulbright Distinguished Chair in North American Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.</p><p><strong>Date and Time</strong></p><p>Tuesday 9 May 2023, 17:30 - 19:00 (London).</p><p><strong>Venue</strong></p><p>Aga Khan Centre (Atrium Conference Room),<br/>10 Handyside Street,<br/>London N1C 4DN</p><p><strong>Organiser</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.aku.edu/ismc/Pages/home.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Aga Khan University's Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilisations (AKU-ISMC)</a>, London.</p><p><strong>Booking</strong></p><p>The event is free, but booking is essential. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-ubiquitous-muslim-tickets-560344564677" rel="nofollow">Book your ticket now</a> and join us in person.</p><p>*The lecture will be followed by a reception.<br/> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Layal Mohammad<br/>Manager, Marketing and Communications<br/>The Aga Khan University (International) in the United Kingdom<br/>Aga Khan Centre, 10 Handyside Street, London N1C 4DN</p><p>Phone: +44 [0] 20 7380 3839<br/>Website: <a href="http://www.aku.edu/ismc" rel="nofollow">www.aku.edu/ismc</a></p><p>Incorporated in England as a company limited by guarantee no. 4448389  Registered Charity Number 1179136</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:layal.n.mohammad@aku.edu">layal.n.mohammad@aku.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.aku.edu/ismc/events/pages/event-detail.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.aku.edu/ismc/events/pages/event-detail.aspx?EventID=2301&amp;Title=The%20Ubiquitous%20Muslim&amp;fbclid=IwAR2cR3-CvD…</a></div></div></div></description>

Individual stories are powerful and have much potential to personalize the often-misunderstood practice of conversion therapy.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Whether or not you have formal training in writing or storytelling, I want to hear from you! I am putting together an edited volume of stories about conversion therapy as told by survivors themselves.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Though I am interested in all compelling stories, I am particularly keen to receive submissions written by trans folx, POC, and Muslim and Jewish individuals. I am also interested in submissions by individuals who underwent conversion therapy in non-religious contexts. But again, <strong>any and all submissions will be seriously considered</strong>.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I am looking for stories that center on one or two specific moments of your time in conversion therapy, whether it be your time in one-on-one meetings with your conversion therapist; your experience in group conversion therapy; or a story about your time at a conversion therapy conference meeting (e.g., Exodus International). Rather than looking for a broad survey of <i>all</i> your experiences in conversion therapy, I am seeking stories that center in on this one or these two moments to really offer a sensuous, focused narrative. These stories are best told when you really paint a picture of a particular moment or moments, so ensure to include a fully fleshed-out portrait of what this moment or these two moments were like by including lots of details (it’s always good to engage your readers’ senses!). Of course, you can fit your story into your larger story (e.g., snippets from your childhood, the enduring effects of conversion therapy, where you are now, etc.), but the main thrust of your submission should focus on this one moment or two moments in conversion therapy.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Submissions should run approximately 2,000-3,000 words. I am aiming to have all stories submitted by July 15, 2023 (though this deadline could be flexible). </span></span></p><p><span><span>I’d be more than happy to answer any and all questions you may have. Please feel free to reach out to me by e-mail (<a href="mailto:lucas.fww@gmail.com">lucas.fww@gmail.com</a>).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Thank you so much for considering contributing—I very much look forward to hearing from you.</span></span></p><p><span><span>All the best,<br/>Lucas F.

In response, Taiwan’s indigenous people allied with the global indigenous rights movement and expanded their hunting rights in the 2005 Indigenous Peoples Basic Law. Taiwan’s indigenous people, including the Atayal hunters in this ethnography, contend that their traditional ecological knowledge sustains the balance of their local ecosystems, and many Atayal people point to the Buddhist release of life ceremony as a threat to ecological balance. Nicolaisen will argue that by seeking to substitute “equality of life” for “human equality,” LCA aims to liberate sentient beings from the constraints of liberal humanism, but in doing so, they also propagate Han colonial policies toward indigenous peoples. Yet, as the indigenous people ally with the indigenous rights movement and their Christian churches, they rely on the institutions of liberal humanism and Christianity to resist Han colonialism.</div><div><p><b>About the Speaker</b><br/>Jeffrey NICOLAISEN is currently a post-doctoral research fellow at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and Ca’ Foscari University of Venice. He earned his Ph.D. in Religion at Duke University. His research uses Taiwanese traditions and teachings to rethink networks of human and nonhuman agency and the ethics of multi-species interaction between Han and indigenous people, dogs, and monkeys in Taiwan.

<p>Conference 2023: Religious Experience and the Phenomenology of Nature</p>
<p>Hosted by the National University of Galway and St. Angela’s College, Sligo, 16th– 19th August 2023</p>
<p>Call for Abstracts/PapersThe Theme of the Conference</p>
<p>Faced as we are with climate change, mass extinctions of species, global pandemics, there is probably no more pressing theme today than that of nature. It is, however, not at all clear what we mean by ‘nature’, and whether discourse about nature is even meaningful today. Many speak of the ‘death of nature’ while at another extreme we find the exhortation toward a ‘re-enchantment’ of [by] nature. What the conference aims to explore is the place of religious experience within this our current situation.</p>
<p>Nature philosophy, including environmental ethics, but also the revival in Schellingian themes and the rediscovery within Phenomenology of the question of nature (Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Husserl), questions any unidirectional subject/object relation to nature. Nature is that in which we find ourselves as human beings and despite our molding of our environments, according to such a view, the human engagement with the world itself embodies nature. The emphasis on embodiment shows not alone the limits of dualisms, but also the commonality of the human with the natural world in which we are and breathe. The inter-subjective experience of such being in nature and the inter-corporeal being with animals and plants around us is reflected in the sacramentality of religious observance from totemic rituals to the Christian Eucharist.</p>
<p>Inspired by the overcoming of dualisms of body and mind and nature and freedom deriving from the Phenomenology and Schelling, we can re-examine the religious sense of nature as containing sacredness. This religious sense can be understood metaphysically as an intuition of reality appearing as unapproachable. Phenomenologically, the question as to the source of this sense of the inapproachable and sacred can be understood in terms of feelings of awe (e.g., Otto). Not alone can nature be a source or locus of religious experience, but it may also be the case that religious affectivity gives us access to nature beyond the objectifying and instrumentalizing tendencies of Modernity. In this respect, we can think of the phenomenologies of life (Bergson, Tymieniecka, Henry), which explore modes of appearance of nature beyond the dualities of mechanism and vitalism. These accounts draw on – explicitly or implicitly – religious motifs such Christian notion of life as Christ, Vedantic life as Sat (Truth of Being, identical with self-consciousness and fullness), or Islamic God as truth or reality (<em>al-Haqq</em>), as well as other concepts across many traditions which are connecting life and nature. These motifs can be understood as compatible with the growing movement of panpsychism in the philosophy of mind (Strawson, Goff, Chalmers, Nagel) and the philosophy of life in biology (Varela, Maturana, Wilson).</p>
<p>Living through a pandemic it is important to hear [here?] attend to the core meaning of the word – <em>pan demos</em>, concerning all the people. Just as nature is everywhere, so any discourse about dwelling in nature (eco-logy) must be seen to concern the totality of human experience, in the sense of the full richness of its diversity. One manner in which such diverse experience can be understood is the way in which nature is experienced as a temporal phenomenon. This is clear already in the experience of the cyclicality of the seasons. It is also manifest in the current sense of ecological crisis which draws on a religious sensibility that has remained present in different guises through Modernity, namely the eschatological. In attempting to think nature with respect to religious experience, we are thinking within the intersection of temporal strands: mortal time, conscious time, cyclical, indefinite time, eternal, creative ‘time’. Understood eschatologically or messianically this relation is one in which ending is woven into the fabric of time: time as ending, transforming of the past in the present and the opening up of a new future, time of forgiveness, repentance, grace and judgment (<em>kairos</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in thinking of nature from a specifically Christian standpoint, we are invariably drawn into the thought of Incarnation and Creation. The complexities of both terms indicate ambiguities in the articulation of nature within the religious experience. Understood as creation, nature can be understood as a domain of divine bounty to be valued and cared for <em>or</em> as an object to be mastered and exploited, while remaining a source of temptation away from the creator. The prohibition on idols emphasized the distance between divinity and nature, making questionable any source of religious experience within nature. The ambiguity here can be seen in the place of beauty which is sometimes affirmed within Medieval philosophy as a ‘transcendental’ (along with goodness, unity, truth), but is more often passed over, something which has been emphasized by such figures as Maritain and von Balthasar. Yet, if the Incarnation is taken seriously as a second creation, then the underlying motif is not power but self-emptying (<em>kenosis</em>) and understanding nature in terms of this event is to approach it in its materiality as touched by divine presence. Indeed, it is the Incarnation historically was instrumental in the modification of the prohibition on idols and the re-conceiving of the relation of image to divinity.</p>
<p>A more immanentist account of God and divinity, broadly speaking polytheistic, allows for a less ambivalent account of nature. The “world is full of gods” (Aeschylus) or at least there are domains of gods and spirits – sacred groves, forests, mountain tops – where human experience is confronted with nature as overwhelming, as powerful, as forbidding. Yet, in such accounts, there are ways towards the divine, through rituals of cleansing and purification or through ecstatic experiences of possession. Boundaries can be crossed while retaining a reverence for nature as that which has a being in and of itself, which is for the human only as a gift of its own bounty.</p>
<p>Pantheism and panentheism in understanding nature as pervaded by or identical with the divinity, speaks to an experience of participation with nature, which goes further towards a learned fusion with nature, where the full realization of the self is in its incorporation in the divine wholeness.</p>
<p>The experience of nature and divinity is reflected in divisions within society and politics. The manner in which the divinity is gendered or represented in racially specific ways and the manner conversely in which human beings are stratified in terms of their proximity to or distance from nature have been used and continue to be used to justify relations of oppression. The mastery of nature goes hand in hand with a mastery of nature within the self and of the mastery and servility of genders, races and classes.</p>

It is also manifest in the current sense of ecological crisis which draws on a religious sensibility that has remained present in different guises through Modernity, namely the eschatological. In attempting to think nature with respect to religious experience, we are thinking within the intersection of temporal strands: mortal time, conscious time, cyclical, indefinite time, eternal, creative ‘time’. Understood eschatologically or messianically this relation is one in which ending is woven into the fabric of time: time as ending, transforming of the past in the present and the opening up of a new future, time of forgiveness, repentance, grace and judgment (<em>kairos</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in thinking of nature from a specifically Christian standpoint, we are invariably drawn into the thought of Incarnation and Creation. The complexities of both terms indicate ambiguities in the articulation of nature within the religious experience. Understood as creation, nature can be understood as a domain of divine bounty to be valued and cared for <em>or</em> as an object to be mastered and exploited, while remaining a source of temptation away from the creator. The prohibition on idols emphasized the distance between divinity and nature, making questionable any source of religious experience within nature. The ambiguity here can be seen in the place of beauty which is sometimes affirmed within Medieval philosophy as a ‘transcendental’ (along with goodness, unity, truth), but is more often passed over, something which has been emphasized by such figures as Maritain and von Balthasar. Yet, if the Incarnation is taken seriously as a second creation, then the underlying motif is not power but self-emptying (<em>kenosis</em>) and understanding nature in terms of this event is to approach it in its materiality as touched by divine presence. Indeed, it is the Incarnation historically was instrumental in the modification of the prohibition on idols and the re-conceiving of the relation of image to divinity.</p>
<p>A more immanentist account of God and divinity, broadly speaking polytheistic, allows for a less ambivalent account of nature. The “world is full of gods” (Aeschylus) or at least there are domains of gods and spirits – sacred groves, forests, mountain tops – where human experience is confronted with nature as overwhelming, as powerful, as forbidding. Yet, in such accounts, there are ways towards the divine, through rituals of cleansing and purification or through ecstatic experiences of possession. Boundaries can be crossed while retaining a reverence for nature as that which has a being in and of itself, which is for the human only as a gift of its own bounty.</p>
<p>Pantheism and panentheism in understanding nature as pervaded by or identical with the divinity, speaks to an experience of participation with nature, which goes further towards a learned fusion with nature, where the full realization of the self is in its incorporation in the divine wholeness.</p>
<p>The experience of nature and divinity is reflected in divisions within society and politics. The manner in which the divinity is gendered or represented in racially specific ways and the manner conversely in which human beings are stratified in terms of their proximity to or distance from nature have been used and continue to be used to justify relations of oppression. The mastery of nature goes hand in hand with a mastery of nature within the self and of the mastery and servility of genders, races and classes.</p>

<p>Conference 2023: Religious Experience and the Phenomenology of Nature</p>
<p>Hosted by the National University of Galway and St. Angela’s College, Sligo, 16th– 19th August 2023</p>
<p>Call for Abstracts/PapersThe Theme of the Conference</p>
<p>Faced as we are with climate change, mass extinctions of species, global pandemics, there is probably no more pressing theme today than that of nature. It is, however, not at all clear what we mean by ‘nature’, and whether discourse about nature is even meaningful today. Many speak of the ‘death of nature’ while at another extreme we find the exhortation toward a ‘re-enchantment’ of [by] nature. What the conference aims to explore is the place of religious experience within this our current situation.</p>
<p>Nature philosophy, including environmental ethics, but also the revival in Schellingian themes and the rediscovery within Phenomenology of the question of nature (Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Husserl), questions any unidirectional subject/object relation to nature. Nature is that in which we find ourselves as human beings and despite our molding of our environments, according to such a view, the human engagement with the world itself embodies nature. The emphasis on embodiment shows not alone the limits of dualisms, but also the commonality of the human with the natural world in which we are and breathe. The inter-subjective experience of such being in nature and the inter-corporeal being with animals and plants around us is reflected in the sacramentality of religious observance from totemic rituals to the Christian Eucharist.</p>
<p>Inspired by the overcoming of dualisms of body and mind and nature and freedom deriving from the Phenomenology and Schelling, we can re-examine the religious sense of nature as containing sacredness. This religious sense can be understood metaphysically as an intuition of reality appearing as unapproachable. Phenomenologically, the question as to the source of this sense of the inapproachable and sacred can be understood in terms of feelings of awe (e.g., Otto). Not alone can nature be a source or locus of religious experience, but it may also be the case that religious affectivity gives us access to nature beyond the objectifying and instrumentalizing tendencies of Modernity. In this respect, we can think of the phenomenologies of life (Bergson, Tymieniecka, Henry), which explore modes of appearance of nature beyond the dualities of mechanism and vitalism. These accounts draw on – explicitly or implicitly – religious motifs such Christian notion of life as Christ, Vedantic life as Sat (Truth of Being, identical with self-consciousness and fullness), or Islamic God as truth or reality (<em>al-Haqq</em>), as well as other concepts across many traditions which are connecting life and nature. These motifs can be understood as compatible with the growing movement of panpsychism in the philosophy of mind (Strawson, Goff, Chalmers, Nagel) and the philosophy of life in biology (Varela, Maturana, Wilson).</p>
<p>Living through a pandemic it is important to hear [here?] attend to the core meaning of the word – <em>pan demos</em>, concerning all the people. Just as nature is everywhere, so any discourse about dwelling in nature (eco-logy) must be seen to concern the totality of human experience, in the sense of the full richness of its diversity. One manner in which such diverse experience can be understood is the way in which nature is experienced as a temporal phenomenon. This is clear already in the experience of the cyclicality of the seasons. It is also manifest in the current sense of ecological crisis which draws on a religious sensibility that has remained present in different guises through Modernity, namely the eschatological. In attempting to think nature with respect to religious experience, we are thinking within the intersection of temporal strands: mortal time, conscious time, cyclical, indefinite time, eternal, creative ‘time’. Understood eschatologically or messianically this relation is one in which ending is woven into the fabric of time: time as ending, transforming of the past in the present and the opening up of a new future, time of forgiveness, repentance, grace and judgment (<em>kairos</em>).</p>

<p><strong><em>Memory and Poiesis between Aesthetics and Rhetoric</em></strong></p>

<p>Edited by Amalia Salvestrini and Fosca Mariani Zini</p>


<p>Among the various fields that have historically contributed to the constitution of Aesthetics as an autonomous discipline in the 18th century is rhetoric, from which Aesthetics has taken terms, concepts and problems that it later develops and transforms (Saint Girons; Franzini; etc.). One of the themes with which the relationship between Aesthetics and Rhetoric can be investigated is memory, understood in its poietic dimension that concerns various fields of human productive and artistic activity.</p>
<p>The issue will be divided into two sections: the first will specifically explore the theme of memory, the second will open the debate around the possibility of the relationship between Aesthetics and Rhetoric.</p>

<p><em>Section I</em></p>
<p>Memory, the fourth part of rhetoric after <em>inventio</em>, <em>dispositio</em>, <em>elocutio</em> and before <em>actio</em>, has not only a receptive dimension, so to speak, in which experiential data are deposited, and in particular, as far as rhetoric is concerned, the elements of the discourse to be delivered are deposited in an organised manner. Memory also has a poietic, creative dimension, which is in some ways connected to <em>inventio</em> and which reworks acquired data. Thanks to its structure, whether natural or artificial, memory not only provides the places within which to organise discourse, but also the inventive basis for the creative elaboration of data. In the interaction between <em>inventio</em> and <em>memoria</em>, i.e. between the ability to find the appropriate arguments and the reasoning schemes that structure the rhetorical memory, the poietic and creative activity is generated, and enables the production of something new, a work, such as speech in the case of the rhetorician. The dislocation of rhetorical concepts in different disciplines, visible for example in the use of the rhetoric <em>conveniens</em> or <em>decor</em> in other disciplines such as theology or architecture, makes one reflect on the possibility that rhetorical memory, and specifically the poietic meaning of memory, also goes to structure cognitive and productive processes in other spheres.</p>
<p>In classical rhetoric, and Ciceronian rhetoric in particular (see F. Yates, <em>The Art of Memory</em>), the poietic value of memory emerges in the possibility of arranging in “artificially” reorganised mental spaces the material of discourse and thereby constructing it. Poiesis thus occurs as much in the construction of a memory building, as attested to by the numerous architectural metaphors that delimit the spaces ready to accommodate the discursive material. For example, it happens in the composition of the discourse itself, when its elements are first found (<em>inventio</em>) among the available <em>loci</em>, to be later fixed in the memory building, once congruously arranged according to the rules of the <em>aptum</em> and <em>ornatus</em>.</p>
<p>Mary Carruthers’ studies have amply shown how in the early Middle Ages memory techniques were used for meditation on the sacred page, contributing to the construction of veritable edifices of thought in which material was not only neatly conserved, but also available and rearranged in a variety of ways. There is the fabrication of mental images or cognitive frameworks for thinking and composing, but also monastic art develops in the sense of an "aesthetic of memory" rather than representation and mimesis. In addition, memory acquires the role of a "cogitation matrix" in order to retrieve and reconfigure memories according to a "random access mnemonic scheme", following a "memorial architecture".</p>
<p>In the light of these premises, the central question arises around which this call intends to gather contributions in order to outline possible answers: to what extent have the modes of poiesis been given according to a rhetorical space, inventive rather than receptive, of memory?</p>
<p>We welcome contributions on any historical period, from antiquity to the contemporary, and in any philosophical and artistic sphere (painting, music, architecture, etc.) that intend to pay attention to poietic forms that have enacted rhetorical structures and strategies of memory. This kind of enactment can be found both at the level of the project, i.e. of conception, and at the level of the work and its aesthetic fruition, where for example an element of the (art)work is assumed as a place of memory with a precise “persuasive” purpose.</p>

<p>The main question concerning the rhetorical scope of human poiesis can thus be articulated in the following areas:</p>
<p>-        Memory in the process of poietic conception</p>
<p>-        The work as sedimentation of memory and inventive openness</p>
<p>-        The sites of memory and the rhetorical effects on the passions</p>
<p>-        Memory and rhetoric in the arts (painting, architecture, music, etc.)</p>

<p><em>Section II</em></p>
<p>The issue also includes a more general section aimed at stimulating theoretical and historiographical debate around the possibility of the relationship between aesthetics and rhetoric. The dialectic between reason and sensibility, demonstration and argumentation is one of the theoretical points on which the debate has been conducted at least in the last century (e.g. Perelman and Preti), even though it has its roots in history. Reflections on the relationship between aesthetics and rhetoric have also resulted around specific aesthetic concepts of rhetorical origin, such as the sublime and metaphor, but have also involved issues both relating to knowledge in the context of postmodern perspectives on the undermining of truth (Gruppo µ), and relating to the rhetorical (social and artistic) strategies of the postmodern (Baudrillard).</p>

<p>The issue welcomes contributions that want to deepen the following themes, or others inspired by the perspective outlined here.</p>
<p>-        Demonstration/argumentation</p>
<p>-        Reason/feeling</p>
<p>-        Text and image</p>
<p>-        Sublime between aesthetics and rhetoric</p>
<p>-        Metaphor and knowledge</p>
<p>-        Rhetoric and postmodernism </p>
<p>-        Arts (painting, music, theatre, cinema, etc.) and rhetoric</p>

<p>Both articles and short notes on this topic will be accepted for this section.</p>

<p>Article deadline: 30 November 2023</p>
<p>Expected release: July 2024</p>

<p>Articles can be written in Italian, French and English</p>

<p>Articles should be sent to the following addresses:</p>

The deadline is March 1, 2023. You may find the full description of our CFP here: <a href="https://papers.aarweb.org/pu/religion-and-cities-unit" rel="nofollow">Religion and Cities 2023 CFP</a>.  This year AAR changed its policy. You no longer need to be a paid AAR member to submit (no cost to submit). </p><p>The Religion and Cities Unit seeks papers that analyze the interactive relationship between religion and urban environments at the AAR’s Annual Meeting. What theoretical models do we draw upon to engage the infrastructure, activities, and culture of cities across the globe? We are open to papers or panels that engage the ecological relationship between religion and cities in a variety of ways. We especially encourage papers or panels proposed from non-profit-scholar collaborations.  Inspired by the 2023 Presidential Theme, “La Labor de Nuestras Manos,” we are particularly interested in the following topics:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Secular Afterlives of Abandoned Worship Spaces:</strong></em> Right now, cities across the globe are experiencing what one observer has called an “epidemic” of church closures as churches, mosques, synagogues, and other places of worship permanently shutter their doors. We invite papers or projects that examine the narratives, histories, transformations, religious reincarnations, or secular afterlives of abandoned places of worship in urban spaces across the globe</li><li><em><strong>Labor and Landscapes</strong></em>: Inspired by the history of the San Antonio Riverwalk, the Religion and Cities and Religion and Economy units invite papers and panel proposals for a co-sponsored session that considers the labor of producing and contesting urban and environmental landscapes. This could include literal landscapes of economic and environmental change, infrastructures and land use, green spaces, and urban ecologies. We also welcome proposals focused on the labor of producing imaginative landscapes, including landscapes of memory, border landscapes, and pathways through the citpapers and panel proposals for a co-sponsored session that considers the labor of producing and contesting urban and environmental landscapes</li><li><em><strong>Gender Religion and the City</strong></em>: From women protesting the morality police in Iran to the Biden Administration raising the transgender flag to celebrate International Transgender Day of Visibility to Ms. Marvel visualizing feminism in a mosque in Jersey City, it is an important moment to examine the intersection of gender, religion, and the city. We are interested in papers or projects that examine who has the right to the city through a gendered lens</li><li><strong><em>Non-Profit Collaborations </em></strong>:In recent decades, religious studies scholars and theologians have shifted from researching in communities to researching with communities. We welcome papers and projects to examine how collaborating with community members and/or non-profit organizations has transformed the study of religion and theology in the city. How does partnering with a non-profit organization inspire us not only to reevaluate how and why we do research, but who we do research for? How do community members challenge us to rethink the academic-non-academic divide? And how might religious studies and theological perspectives offer more just solutions to city officials?</li></ul><p>We look forward to reading your proposals and feel free to contact us with questions.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Fatimah Fanusie (<a href="mailto:fanusie@icjs.org">fanusie@icjs.org</a>)</p><p>Rupa Pillai (<a href="mailto:rupillai@sas.upenn.edu">rupillai@sas.upenn.edu</a>)</p><p>Religion and Cities Co-Chairs</p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Fatimah Fanusie </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:fanusie@icjs.org">fanusie@icjs.org</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://papers.aarweb.org/pu/religion-and-cities-unit" target="_blank">https://papers.aarweb.org/pu/religion-and-cities-unit</a></div></div></div></description>

In previous verses, Paul has shown solidarity across the family of God and other identities (including Creation). However, in taking Paul further, Parker asks how contemporary Jesus followers should move forward in these solidarities today? Can movements that claim to care for Creation ignore the continued "groaning" that Black Lives Matter? Further, how do movements bring about the failure of Empire so that marginalized Black bodies AND Creation experience transformation and move out of "groaning?" For all of this to happen, Empires must fail. How do we bring about that failure?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Organizing team:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h5><span>Venus Bender, American Studies, Frankfurt<br/>Dominik Gautier, Protestant Theology, Oldenburg<br/>Nicole Schneider, American Studies, Eichstätt</span></h5></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Amerikahaus München<br/>Karolinenplatz 3<br/>80333 München</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Info &amp; Registration: </span></span></span><a href="https://webmail.server.uni-frankfurt.de/imp/dynamic.php?page=mailbox" rel="nofollow"><span><span><span><span>nicole.schneider@ku.de</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:nicole.schneider@ku.de">nicole.schneider@ku.de</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://bridgingblackfreedomstruggles.com/" target="_blank">https://bridgingblackfreedomstruggles.com</a></div></div></div></description>

<p align="center">The biennial conference of the Nederlands Genootschap voor Godsdienstwetenschappen (NGG) - the Dutch Association for the Study of Religion</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Nijmegen, the Netherlands, November 1-3 2023</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keynote Speakers include Dr. Nadia Fadil (KU Leuven), Dr. Basit Iqbal (McMaster University), Dr. Carly Crouch (Radboud University) and Dr. Birgit Meyer (Utrecht University).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Religiosity and mobility have been topics of research and debate for scholars working with different theoretical, methodological, and disciplinary approaches. In this conference, we explore how the study of religion might be transformed through a focus on mobility in its various forms.</p>
<p>We ask, for instance: How is mobility an integral part of religious traditions? How does religion inform experiences of belonging in migratory contexts? How do political, geographical, cultural, and religious borders shape people’s lives? Their visions of the past and the future? Their experiences of home and belonging? Their aspirations and imaginations of destiny?</p>
<p>We examine how state and/or religious authorities classify migrants and consider the ends towards which such categorization works. We ask how different kinds of borders influence the lives and faiths of people on the move, and consider how these modern forms of mobility have historical roots across a range of sociopolitical and geographical milieus.</p>
<p>Bringing together scholars who work at the intersection of mobility and religion, this conference invites scholars of religion to converse with those working in anthropology and sociology; history, law, and political science; and the study of transnationalism, borders, migration, and refugees, to name just a few fields.</p>
<p>This conference therefore aims to broaden the theoretical and methodological repertoires for future studies of religion in motion whereby mobility and religion are analyzed not as separate themes, but as critical axes of people’s religious experiences across traditions, times, and spaces, with mobility and religion acting as co-constitutive of beliefs, practices and socialities.</p>
<p>We encourage graduate students, early career scholars, and established academics to use this meeting as an opportunity to think through research agendas, challenges, and inspirations for current and future research, particularly those that decenter Europe, or rather, locate Europe as only one yet powerful bulwark, goal, and trajectory in a global world. We also welcome contributions which explore less commonly explored religious and spiritual traditions, alongside those better studied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Topics which might be explored can include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>●      Transformations in refugee religiosity</p>
<p>●      Terror, death and dying en route or in migratory settings</p>
<p>●      (Social) life, resilience, humor and joy en route or in migratory settings</p>

<p>●      The role of religion in forced migration</p>

<p>●      Religion in transit</p>
<p>●      Transnational networks of religious institutions</p>
<p>●      Migration, religion, and racialization</p>
<p>●      The role of religion in enforcing, transcending, or overturning borders</p>
<p>●      The role of borders, boundaries, and crossings in religion</p>
<p>●      Syncretism, hybridity or polyculturalism? Theories on the creation of new religions</p>
<p>●      (The implications of) definitions, including “refugee” and “migrant”</p>
<p>●      Pilgrimage</p>
<p>●      Missionary activities</p>
<p>●      Mobile relics and material religion</p>

With a thematic focus for each issue, the journal is published online in English and Marathi. We are happy to announce the eighteenth call for submissions around the theme, <strong>मिथक /Myth</strong>.</p>
<p>For a story to be a myth, it must have travelled through time. It must have changed multiple hands on its meandering journey, with each hand shaping it in some way big or small. As this form of story travels from one point to another, it morphs into myriad ways. While the specificities of a myth that ground it in a certain socio-political or historical context may change, the ideas that form its core persist through time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can tell a lot about a society from the mythology that it generates. These myths may serve as carriers of society’s dominant value system; they may reveal the things people feared, and the things they revered. A myth about a person can make them seem larger than life, or decimate their reputation; a myth about a place can draw people to it from far and wide, or it can drive people away. Present in all media, including oral, print, and electronic, myths have a way of affecting our psyche in deeply personal ways. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At times, a myth is associated with falsification, a morphing of truth to support devious intentions. It is at odds with hard, empirical fact–data that seeks to reduce the world to pure information. While myth speaks to feelings, data speaks to rationale. While myth is characterised by fluidity, data remains unchanged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do myths mean to you? How do you visualise a myth in your own creative work? How does the free circulation of myth — breaking the bounds of time and space — affect individuals and society? How do societies, individuals or state-systems at the centre of power create or rediscover a myth and provide their own meaning to it? What research and creative production possibilities might there be for exploring or reinterpreting a myth through innovative methodologies?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With such questions and concerns, we would like to receive submissions from artists, scholars, researchers or writers for our 18th edition.</p>
<p>If you are a story-teller, writer, scholar, poet, visual artist, critic, photographer, social scientist, translator, curator or anyone who is interested in addressing the theme of ‘Myth’, do send your work in Marathi and/or English or in audio-visual form by <strong>March 08, 2023</strong> to <a href="mailto:info@hakara.in" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">info@hakara.in</a>.

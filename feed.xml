						<description>Publication Name: Call for Papers for Special Issue of CPR: 'Objectivity and Truth in Cassirer's Philosophy of Culture and Philosophy of Science'<br/><br/><p>REMINDER:</p>
<p>Call for Papers for Special Issue: </p>
<p>'Objectivity and Truth in Cassirer's Philosophy of Culture and Philosophy of Science'</p>
<p>Journal: <em>Continental Philosophy Review</em></p>
<p>Guest Editors: Tobias Endres (TU Braunschweig) and Simon Truwant (KU Leuven) </p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>"Is there really something like an objective theoretical truth [...]? In a time in which such questions can be raised, philosophy cannot stand aside, mute and idle." (Cassirer, Symbol, Myth, and Culture, 61) There is no doubt that this question, which Cassirer found indicative of the European Zeitgeist of the first decades of the twentieth century, also pervades Western culture today. In times of fake news, conspiracy theories, alternative facts, and science denial, as well as the rise of political myth and the erosion of expertise and democratic institutions, doubt about the possibility of objectivity and truth is a defining characteristic of contemporary culture. Hence, if we follow Cassirer, philosophy has once again a crucial societal duty to fulfill: the duty to safeguard some notion of objectivity and of truth against epistemic and cultural relativism, skepticism, and indifference.</p>
<p>This collection of essays reconsiders the enduring relevance of Cassirer's own philosophy in view of this challenge. The <em>Philosophy of Symbolic Forms</em> was after all an ambitious attempt to radically widen and diversify the meaning of objectivity without forfeiting its claims to universality or its firm footing in human reason. By ascribing to mythical, religious, and linguistic perceptions and expressions an objective status that modern Western philosophy had preserved for scientific thought, Cassirer's philosophy can however be taken as either enriching or weakening the ideas of objectivity, truth, and rationality. In view of the current crisis of truth, we thus ask what Cassirer's theory of culture and of science can teach us about the plurality, relativity, or universality of human understanding.</p>
<p>We invite papers that reflect, from a contemporary viewpoint, on Cassirer’s view on objectivity and truth in relation to the plurality of the symbolic forms, their inherent tendencies towards dogmatism, the relativity of their cultural viewpoints, and their unity in the whole of human culture. Within this broad theme, we specifically welcome paper proposals that reflect on the transcendental status of science, its relation to other symbolic forms (incl. language, politics, technology, and art), and its significance for understanding (the present state or the progress of) human culture as a whole. We also welcome papers that initiate a dialogue between Cassirer and other contemporary thinkers on the issues of truth or objectivity. </p>
<p>The special issue will contain a first-time English translation of Cassirer's 1929 inaugural address as rector of Hamburg University: 'Formen und Formwandlungen des philosophischen Wahrheitsbegriffs' (ECW 17). We will give preference to paper submissions that in some way connect to the concept of functional truth that Cassirer suggests in this address (we can send you a pdf copy of the German text upon request).</p>
<p>HOW TO SUBMIT:</p>
<p>Submissions should be no longer than 7000 words and must be written in English. Non-native English speakers may be asked to have their paper proofread by a native English speaker before it goes through the peer review process. Please follow the <em>Instructions for Authors</em> from <em>CPR</em> under </p>
<p>https://www.springer.com/journal/11007/submission-guidelines for citations and formatting.</p>
<p>All papers must be submitted via Editorial Manager under</p>
<p>https://www.editorialmanager.com/mawo/default1.aspx with a note that it is for the special issue on Cassirer <u>and</u> to the Guest Editors' E-Mail-Addresses.</p>
<p>For further information, please contact the guest editors at t.endres@tu-braunschweig.de or simon.truwant@kuleuven.be.</p>
<p>The deadline for submissions is December 15, 2022.</p>

Cold War Imagery in Popular Culture</strong></p><p>Manchester Metropolitan University and the Centre for the Critical Study of Apocalyptic and Millenarian Movements.</p><p>Thursday 13<sup>th</sup> July 2023 at Imperial War Museum North, Manchester, UK.</p><p><strong>Deadline for submissions: Tuesday 28<sup>th</sup> February 2023.</strong></p><p>Since the end of the Cold War, its imagery, atmosphere, and music have been repeatedly appropriated and reappropriated within contemporary popular culture. More than thirty years after the Berlin Wall fell, these images continue to appeal to generations with no memory of the original tensions of the time. From the early Cold War imagery of games such as the <em>Fallout</em> series, or the mid-1980s backdrop of Soviet infiltration in <em>Stranger Things</em>, visual culture, music, and ideas from the period are constantly recycled in popular culture. These images are often linked to fears of nuclear destruction or disturbing post-apocalyptic settings, while also recalling nostalgic and often patriotic images of a lost world of the West. With the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine and heightened fear of nuclear war, these images are being appropriated and applied in new ways online and in popular entertainment.</p><p>This conference invites participants to examine this theme and to explore the complexities of encountering Cold War imagery within popular film, television, video and tabletop games, music, graphic novels and social media content. In particular, it aims to examine the way in which this imagery impacts understandings of the apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic within popular culture. Potential topics might include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>The role of nostalgia and nuclear destruction on screen.</li><li>The influence of popular culture on historical memory.</li><li>“Alternative histories” of the Cold War in popular culture.</li><li>Live action roleplay.</li><li>“Apocalyptic fandom”.</li><li>Use of Cold War-era music in film, television and gaming.</li><li>The role of Cold War narratives and imagery in Marvel/DC franchises media.</li><li>The use of apocalypticism in historical and popular documentaries.</li><li>Cold War imagery on social media related to the Ukraine War.</li><li>Cold War kitsch and ironic nostalgia.</li><li>Player agency in apocalyptic video games.</li></ul><p>The conference will take place on Thursday 13<sup>th</sup> July 2023 at Imperial War Museum North, Manchester, UK. There is no charge for registration/attendance for those presenting papers.</p><p>For submissions, email 250-word abstracts with a short biography to Dr. Andrew Crome <a href="mailto:a.crome@mmu.ac.uk">a.crome@mmu.ac.uk</a> by Tuesday 28<sup>th</sup> February 2023.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Andrew Crome, Senior Lecturer in Early Modern History, Manchester Metropolitan University</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:a.crome@mmu.ac.uk">a.crome@mmu.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://censamm.org/conferences/cold-war-nostalgia" target="_blank">https://censamm.org/conferences/cold-war-nostalgia</a></div></div></div></description>

AGAPE represents the main outcome of the four-year FNS Ambizione project <i>The Greek Imprint on Europe: Patristics and Publishing in the Early Swiss Reformation</i>, based at the Institut d’histoire de la Réformation, University of Geneva.</p><p><a href="http://agapepatristics.net/" rel="nofollow">agapepatristics.net</a></p><p>In contrast to the Renaissance interest in the pagan Antiquity and classical literature, <b>the highly significant rediscovery of the Greek Fathers remains untold and largely understudied</b>. The number of inaccuracies in the regional, national and collective online repertoires available at present turns bibliographical research into a time-consuming and little-rewarding exercise, severely affecting the development of the subject. </p><p>To tackle this issue, AGAPE records <b>any edition of Greek patristic works printed in Europe from 1465 to 1600</b> in the original language, as well as in Latin and vernacular translations. AGAPE refines the available data and substantially improves their level of detail: not only does it link each work to the ID of the <i>Clavis Patrum Graecorum</i> (<b>CPG</b>), the standard authority in the field, but also thoroughly describes all contents (<b>text as well as paratext</b>) and strictly relies on the analysis of at least one copy of each edition.</p><p>AGAPE currently provides access to <b>all editions printed in the fifteenth century</b> (c. 310). Data related to the sixteenth century will be disclosed decade by decade (1501-1510, 1511-1520, 1521-1530 etc.) to ensure reliability.</p><p>Users are encouraged to give their <b>feedback and suggestions </b>through the AGAPE email address available in the colophon of the website homepage.</p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><a href="http://agapepatristics.net/" rel="nofollow">agapepatristics.net</a></p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:p_sachet@yahoo.it">p_sachet@yahoo.it</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="http://agapepatristics.net/" target="_blank">http://agapepatristics.net</a></div></div></div></description>

If research plans were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students are encouraged to submit proposals based on work in progress that critically reflects upon pandemic research modalities through methodological innovation. NUS students are also encouraged to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to interact and exchange ideas with students from other regions whose interests focus on Southeast Asia.</p><p>--------------------</p><p><br/><span><strong>REQUIREMENTS &amp; EXPECTATIONS</strong></span></p><p>Successful candidates for the fellowship are expected to submit a draft of their papers by <strong>26 April 2023</strong>.

Nevertheless, in recent decades, scholars have advanced a more nuanced understanding of this relationship, depending on which particular aspects are being considered.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>For instance, when considering religion as a practice, one discovers that religious institutions and individuals have used a wide range of technologies since ancient times, including printing and writing to preserve teachings, time-measurement devices and astronomical knowledge to determine the correct ritual time, and, of course, complex ritual actions to attract followers and engage natural and supernatural forces.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>These precedents illustrate the complexity of the relationship between religion and technology, a relationship which encompasses not just technology in its material sense, but techniques such as knowledge organization and the specific methods needed to achieve particular ends. In addition to the way in which technology affects religious practices, their spread, and religious dialogue, new technology underlying communications and the social and digital spheres facilitates the systematization of religious data, making religions more accessible to academic study than ever before.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Thus, what we can state about the relationship of religion and technology is not their separation or antagonism but their entanglement, which calls us to take into account how technology and religion have co-evolved in the past, consider which are the critical engagements of religion with technology today, and imagine how they could develop in the future. Considering all of the above, the theme of this year’s EASR conference encourages participants to present and discuss any aspect relating to religion and technology in the broadest sense, e.g.</span></span></span></span></p><ol><li>The concepts and connotations of technology across various religions.</li><li>Discussing how religions have viewed and treated technology historically and more recently.</li><li>The relationship between religion as practice and theory, or religion and science, including their interactions, conflicts, or other types of interactions.</li><li>Investigating esoteric, magical, or other religious practices as techniques.</li><li>Reflecting the spread and practice of religion via technology. The ways in which religions invent, adopt, and adapt technological innovations, including communication technologies and new media.</li><li>Understanding religion through the lens of concepts associated with social technologies, technological knowledge, etc.</li><li>The use of technologies and techniques in religious studies. Studying religion in the digital age: advances in the digital humanities and beyond. The ways in which existing technologies and their notions influence the study of religion.</li></ol><p><br/><span><span><span><b><span>Important Dates</span></b></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><b><span>Call for Session Proposal</span></b><span> (open and closed panels):<br/>October 1, 2022 – November 15, 2022</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>More details about the conference and paper submission can be found here and in information below: <a href="https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-panels/" rel="nofollow"><span>https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-panels/</span></a></span></span></span></span></span><br/><span><span><span><span><b>Notification of Acceptance of Panels:</b><br/>until November 25, 2022<br/><b>Call for Individual Papers</b><br/>December 1, 2022 - January 31, 2023<br/><b>Notification of Acceptance of Individual Papers</b><br/>February 28, 2023<br/><b>Registration</b></span><br/><u><span><span>Early bird registration</span></span></u><span><span>: until May 31, 2023</span></span><br/><u><span>Standard registration</span></u><span>: until June 30, 2023<span> (Deadline for presenting authors)</span><br/><u>Late registration &amp; on site</u> (non presenting participants): from July 1, 2023</span></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><h3>Contact Conference Secretariat</h3><div><p>Conference and Events Agency “Seven Tips”<br/>Legal name: UAB Kalanis<br/>Rūdninkų str. 18, Vilnius<br/><a href="mailto:conference@seventips.lt">conference@seventips.lt</a><br/>+370 682 28647</p></div></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:conference@seventips.lt">conference@seventips.lt</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-panels/" target="_blank">https://www.easr2023.org/call-for-panels/</a></div></div></div></description>

<p>Like the Conference, the journal strives toward an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to the works of Deleuze and Guattari. The journal invites philosophical, literary, cultural, historical and many other approaches to diverse topics that draw their inspiration from Deleuze and Guattari’s body of work. In this way, the Conference and Camp, as well as the journal, remain true to the spirit of Deleuze and Guattari’s legacy that always resisted traditional categorization.</p></description>

						<description><p>The 2023 Deleuze and Guattari Studies Conference and Camp in Belgrade, Serbia will be the first time this international event takes place in the Balkans.</p>
<p>The Conference and Camp have a long and rich history. The event first took place in 2008 at Cardiff University, Wales (then known as International Deleuze Studies Conference). Since then, the Conference and Camp visited numerous places around the world, including countries in Europe, the Latin America, as well as the US and Canada. There are also editions of the Conference and Camp in Asia and India. Its strong interdisciplinary profile gathers experts, researches, artists and students to discus and exchange ideas, as well as generate new insights in the field of Deleuze and Guattari studies.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Papers - Space, Control, Resistance</strong></p>
<p>‘Control’ is the name which in 1990 Deleuze gave to the ‘new monster’ that is now our present. He said then, and it resonates still, that the most important question of our time is where and how we will find ‘new forms of resistance’.</p>
<p>The old societies of discipline, which Deleuze saw as the predecessor to those of control, operated through spaces of confinement and enclosure. Their crisis gave way to a different type of spatial organization of power: instead of discreet enclosures, we find ourselves in open spaces and within a continuous network. The subject of control is not the molded body in confinement anymore, but a faceless sample, a crowd in constant modulation.</p>
<p>The enclosed and isolated body of the prison has given way to bodies in ‘open prisons’ of connected programs, binary digital systems and their many tools – resulting in a nomadic psyche that carries the panopticon with(in) itself. Like the <em>watchwords</em> of the discipline society, control operates with <em>passwords</em> that regulate space through access/rejection to various types of flows, such as money, information, knowledge, or art.</p>
<p>However, like disciplinary societies, spaces of control offer their own avenues for resistance.  Resistance is never simply a reactive force. Indeed, as Deleuze and Guattari remind us, ‘resistance comes first’. The concepts of line of flight, war machine, micropolitics, deterritorialization, rhizome, becoming-minoritian, or becoming-woman, testify to the importance of thinking resistance in terms of an active force. This thought of the outside is more pertinent now than ever, because as Deleuze once protested, ‘resistance to the present’ is what we lack the most.</p>
<p>Whether one works in architecture, music or cinema, philosophy, art or science, politics, economics or literature, ecology and geography, entertainment, medicine and sport, or issues of race, gender, and sexuality, the question is the same: what is the nature of the form of power we are exposed to today and where can we find real potential for change? How can we think and construct spaces that would act as areas of resistance against the oppressive strategies of control?</p>
<p>The conference aims to show how an engagement with the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari contributes to the project of discovering emancipatory dimensions of space. We welcome explorations of the way philosophy, art, or science create spaces that allow escape and counterattacks? In what way can music, art, or travel act as areas that would not be re-captured by the contemporary network of control? How can internet phenomena, such as piracy or viruses, assist us in scrambling the digital flows of controlled data? Are there perhaps creative potentials even in history, where archaisms would not only feed the mechanisms of control, but also provide avenues for chaosmotic becomings? Or are there arts of control, as Deleuze once suggested, that could also function as forms of resistance?</p>
<p>By turning to these questions, we aspire to enrich the broad field of Deleuze and Guattari studies with new and original insights: across in the disciplines of political and social theory, ethics and logic, psychoanalysis, Anthropocene studies, metaphysics and the theories of new materialisms, epistemology and aesthetics following the affective turn.</p>
<p>We invite paper and panel proposals from scholars of all disciplines, as well as performance and installation proposals from artists related to the theme of the Conference. We also kindly ask students interested in the Camp to send us their applications.</p>

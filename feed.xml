<p> </p>
<p>At the end of 1920, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s first novel, <em>This Side of Paradise</em>, explored the crises of a new generation who had “grown up to find all Gods dead… all faiths in man shaken.” Scholars and theologians concur that American literature, like the culture at large, was undergoing a passage from a spiritual to a secular outlook throughout the 1920s and 30s. This transition was so dramatic and widespread that that the years between 1925-1935 have been termed “the American Religious Depression.” Indeed, many texts from these two decades present their own version of the larger cultural secularization thesis.</p>
<p>But while the secularization thesis is not wrong, it does not provide a complete picture of American literary history between the World Wars. This project seeks to fill this gap by examining the role of spiritual discourse in the literature of the era. It is true that many modernist texts convey a sense of cultural decay or spiritual darkness through cynicism, iconoclasm, or unintelligibility. However, there were a number of American writers who, despite the zeitgeist in which they lived and worked, still insisted on extending either hope, faith, or charity to their readers.</p>
<p>A number of scholars, critics, and editors called for a “spiritual readjustment” in American literature during the 1920s and 30s, and a cadre of writers were working towards this "readjustment" in their fiction or poetry. Some wrote using spiritually coded terms such as transcendence, surrender, sacrifice, or mystery. Others wrote within Judeo-Christian traditions, but were focused on righting injustices within those traditions. There were some who understood faith--although not necessarily religious faith-- as a human necessity. In this expanded sense, faith can mean belief in humanity, meaning, or commitment to progress. </p>
<p>This volume will consist of readings of American texts from the 1920s and 1930s which foreground the presence or impact of the following spiritually-inflected terms in conversation with the ethos of literary modernism:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Hope</p>
<p> Belief</p>
<p>Transcendence</p>
<p>Mystery</p>
<p>Compassion</p>
<p>Connectedness or Community</p>
<p>Sacrifice</p>
<p>Redemption, among other spiritually-inflected terms</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This edited collection will trace the resurgence of these metaphysical concepts in the work of American writers who were not identified with formal religion as well as those who were. I am happy to receive proposals for chapters which reconsider the work of canonical authors, but would especially welcome proposals treating lesser known or neglected writers of the 20s and 30s. </p>
<p>Please submit chapter proposals of 300-500 words by January 8, 2024 to Windy Petrie at <a href="mailto:wpetrie@apu.edu">wpetrie@apu.edu</a>. Potential contributors will receive a response by January 26. Complete chapters of between 7,000- 10,000 words will be due July 15.</p>

			<title>[ March 7, 2024 -  March 8, 2024] Conference or similar: Between Power and Authority: Arendt on the Constitution and the Courts</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/115142</link>
						<description>Venue: 1448 Annadale Road<br/><br/><p>The U.S. Supreme Court today faces a crisis of legitimacy. More than half of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Court—the lowest in over three decades. Following a slate of rulings on abortion, affirmative action, student debt, and freedom of religion, an increasing number of Americans no longer believe the Court is impartial, viewing it as simply another partisan institution. As a result, many are calling for various reforms of the Court, including term limits and packing the court. At the same time, the Court has, even at this moment, has struck down racially motivated gerrymandering in Alabama and has refused to accept the Independent State Legislature Theory that would allow states to overturn the will of their voters. There is little doubt that politics is at play in the Supreme Court; at the same time, the Court still gives credence to the idea of the rule of law and not men. </p>
<p>In <em>On Revolution</em>, Hannah Arendt places the American constitutional tradition at the center of her inquiry into the founding and preserving of political freedom. The success of the American Revolution, for her, consisted in two things: its unleashing of citizen power through the principle of  federalist dispersion of power and its institutionalization of authority in the Supreme Court and the United States Constitution. Regarding the former, Arendt argues that the embrace of federalism allowed for the multiplication and flourishing of power within a stable system. Regarding the latter, Arendt offers an original reading of the Supreme Court as the successor of the Roman Senate. The Court's authority combined with the surprising fact that the Constitution came to be worshiped allowed the United States to achieve authority for its laws absent religious sanction. This authority tied together permanence and change, permitting the country to develop and grow while also maintaining order and stability. In short, the combination of power and authority that emerged from  the worship of the United States Constitution became the modern condition for the possibility of founding free government.</p>

<p>This conference aims to bring together scholars of Arendt’s constitutional thought and those working in political and legal theory more broadly to pursue the following questions: Is the Supreme Court still a legal institution, one that wields and deserves the authority imbued by the rule of law? Is the Supreme Court simply an undemocratic institution of power? If the latter, should we abandon the charade that the Supreme Court is above politics?  Or, should we work to uphold the reality and the illusion that the Court is a legal and not simply a political institution? Any answers to these questions request that we face what is lost if and when the Supreme Court is no longer recognized as a seat of authority. We are especially interested in papers that address: Arendt’s conception of power and/or authority, Arendt’s constitutional and/or legal theory, and the relevance of all of this for current discussions of the Supreme Court and constitutional politics.</p>

<p>Submission Deadline: <strong>15th of December, 2023</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>The nature of concepts continues to be one of the most fundamental conundrum around which philosophical reflection has converged. Understanding the role of concepts and their intersection with other dimensions of experience is directly related to investigating “human nature” and the structure of world and reality. Inquiries into the functioning of concepts rest at the heart not only of an internal bifurcation in Classical phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger) but have notably played a pivotal role in analytical debates (Russell, Moore). Especially in the last 30 years, the philosophical discussion about the role of concepts and the nature of conceptual content has been mainly subsumed within the dichotomous debate about conceptualism and non-conceptualism. Scholars have been engaged in classifying concepts (Benoist, Peacocke), determining their relation to perception (Sellars, McDowell, Brewer, Hopp), negating/limiting their cognitive role (Dreyfus) or accounting for a non-conceptual content of perception (Dretske, Travis, Bermúdez). This extremely intricate, yet rich and fruitful debate has attracted scholars from different traditions of thought who have engaged in metaphysical and epistemological analysis in the broadest sense. In order to answer the question regarding the nature of the concept, scholars have employed various strategies, either through an investigation into the history of philosophy – from Aristotle, to Hume, Kant, Hegel, Husserl, and Wittgenstein – or by attempting to approach the question from both the analytical and continental traditions: exploiting pragmatism, phenomenology, and philosophy of language.<br/> <br/> The conference aims to gather diverse perspectives of the topic at hand and enrich critical debate. To that end, the conference will bring together scholars from diverse backgrounds in order to discuss the key problematics concerning the nature of conceptual/non-conceptual content, such as: What are concepts? How shall we understand the relationship between the conceptual and non-conceptual spheres? What is at stake in the conceptual/non-conceptualism debate?</p>
<p>Papers are welcome that try to answer these and related questions. Suitable topics may include, but are not limited to:<br/> -       the nature of concepts<br/> -       the origin of concepts<br/> -       the relationship between concepts and perception<br/> -       the relationship between concepts and knowledge<br/> -       the role of concepts in human experience in general<br/> -       the nature of concepts versus the nature of the world<br/> -       critical analyses of the debate on conceptualism/non-conceptualism</p>

<p><strong>Contemporary Pagans in Public Interaction: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Constructing Religion in Central and Eastern Europe </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are seeking papers for a peer-reviewed edited volume, to be published by Bloomsbury Press with the editor Eglė Aleknaitė, Vytautas Magnus University (<a href="mailto:egle.aleknaite@vdu.lt">egle.aleknaite@vdu.lt</a>).</p>
<p>With questioning of secularization thesis and recognizing the unceasing public role of religion in modern societies, scholars have observed and analyzed numerous collaborative public interactions between secular and religious actors. In current academic debates, however, contemporary Pagans are rarely seen as religious actors seeking the public role. The proposed volume aims to present case studies analyzing contemporary Pagans’ engagement in public interactions in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Pagans of the region differ in their disposition to seek the public role and interact with secular actors. Some of them, for example, engage in identity and heritage politics and interact with other actors through their work at secular heritage institutions, academia, or public event organizing. The landscape within which Pagans act and the actors which they interact with is historically and regionally specific because of a number of pre-Soviet and pre-socialist, Soviet and socialist, and post-Soviet and post-socialist developments in Eastern and Central Europe. The countries of the region share relatively similar experiences of 19th-century nationalism, Soviet and socialist modernization and anti-religious policies, and post-Soviet and post-socialist processes. Some contemporary Pagan communities of the region are building on imageries and conceptualizations of religion, spirituality, and culture and related practices and institutions that have been developed since the nationalist movements of the 19th-early 20th century, or later Soviet and Socialist periods. Post-Soviet and post-socialist developments related to changes in the politics of religion and culture administration also shaped the landscapes and opportunities of Pagans’ interaction with various secular and religious actors. Finally, sharing concerns over globalization, migration, gender politics, and the like, some Pagans recently got involved in discourses, practices, and events of nationalist populism that has been recently on the rise in the region.</p>
<p>Such interactions demonstrate Pagans’ attitudes towards the surrounding society and the nature of their relationships with it, and, on the other hand, the impact of the state, the majority religion, and other relevant actors. They also serve as situations within which essential categories and ideas are constructed, reified, and performed on variously defined terms that depend on the actors' power relations, ideologies, and goals. Collaborations with public institutions are opportunities for establishing and maintaining relationships, embodying, contesting, and negotiating religious, national, ethnic and local identities, and constructing the very Pagan tradition, a category of religion, and boundaries between the religious and the secular.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking for papers between 8,000 and 10,000 words from a range of theoretical, methodological, and disciplinary perspectives. Contributors are invited to address such topics as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactions with the state and other secular institutions and actors in the context of academia, public culture, identity politics, heritage management, environmental initiatives, and other spheres;</li>
<li>Interactions with other religious actors in the context of academia, public culture, identity politics, heritage management, environmental initiatives, and other spheres;</li>
<li>The interpretation and use of the legacy of pre-Soviet/socialist and Soviet/socialist narratives and practices by Pagans and against Pagans;</li>
<li>Construction of religion, conceptualization, and performance of Paganism as religion and culture, use of secular and religious discourse and authorities in interactions;</li>
<li>Participation in discourses, practices, and events of nationalist populism;</li>
<li>Interactions in the context of gender politics.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Please send an abstract (max 200 words) with name and affiliation (if relevant), a proposal (max 1000 words), and an anticipated word count, to Eglė Aleknaitė at <a href="mailto:egle.aleknaite@vdu.lt.">egle.aleknaite@vdu.lt.</a> Please do feel free to contact the editor with any questions.</p>

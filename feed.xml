If I do not reach deep into moral imagination and envision a world beyond the supremacist, nationalistic, and oppressive culture in which I live, then I have sacrificed my principles and embarrassed my calling as a minister of the gospel.</em><br/>– Frank A. Thomas,<br/><em>How to Preach a Dangerous Sermon</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Rhetoric is indeed, as many theologians feared,</em> <em>risky and messy</em>.<br/>– Majorie O’Rourke Boyle,<br/>“Rhetorical Theology: Charity Seeking Charity”</p><p>~</p><p>In <em>Life’s Too Short to Pretend You’re Not Religious</em>, David Dark observes that religion — and we’d add rhetoric — “is the question of how we dispose our energies, how we see fit to organize our own lives and, in many cases, the lives of others.” Majorie O’Rourke Boyle nicely captures the contingency of such a claim when she notes that rhetoric — and we’d add religion — is risky and messy. Religion and rhetoric coalesce around virtually every human concern, which is why we feel compelled to open this call for papers asking what roles religious rhetorics, and rhetorics of religion more generally, play in helping us to “envision a world beyond the supremacist, nationalistic, and oppressive culture” that Frank Thomas calls out in <em>How To Preach a Dangerous Sermon</em>? It’s a perennial question, of course, but as scholarship that interrogates the intersections of rhetoric and religion continues to proliferate, Thomas reminds us of the role religious rhetorics play in cultivating communities of resistance, especially ones that can rise to the challenge of imagining a more hopeful and just future starting in the present.</p><p>We invite scholars to submit individual or coauthored paper and panel proposals focusing on any project related to rhetoric and religion, but we are especially interested in work that helps us imagine the resources that can be cultivated from the study of religious rhetorics, whether those resources are pedagogical, philosophical, homiletic, activist-focused, or something else.</p><p>As with the previous <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/utk.edu/rhetoric-and-religion/" rel="nofollow">Rhetoric &amp; Religious Traditions</a> conference that took place in 2018, presenters might examine the intersections between work on religious rhetorics and other subfields of communication studies, rhetoric and writing studies, religious studies, homiletics, sociology, anthropology, or other fields that engage with the philosophy of language and communication. Presenters might discuss the ways scholarship on religion and rhetoric might be invigorated by studying spiritual traditions and practices of particular groups. Other researchers might examine the ways scholarship on rhetoric and religion can help us explore key cultural concerns in our current moment, including how problems like the ones Thomas names — things like white supremacy, xenophobia, and misinformation — can be engaged using the resources of particular rhetorical and religious traditions.</p><p>Importantly, we also want to make space for work that is anti-religious, non-religious, or takes a critical perspective on religious rhetoric. We wish to cultivate an interdisciplinary space that welcomes believers, skeptics, atheists, activists, scholars, and religious leaders. We especially hope scholars doing work on non-Western religious traditions will consider submitting a proposal.</p><p>We welcome Single Paper and Full Panel (3-4 speakers) proposals. Please limit Single Paper proposals to 250 words and Full Panel Proposals to 500 words. For Full Panel proposals, please include the names/email addresses of each speaker.</p><p>Please submit proposals via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMkl30ZuAHbQyLnm30Fv47SUt-EEA29P58GVy1xTUEV7Cz3Q/viewform" rel="nofollow"><strong>submission link</strong></a> by March 15, 2023.</p><p>Inquires can be sent to Dr. Will Duffy and Dr. Andre E.

The wider narrative across the exhibition examines football’s ability to champion social causes, promote marginalised voices, and create opportunities for inclusion and diversity in ways no other sport can.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>The exhibition provides a narrative on the subject through a snapshot of social history and contemporary commentary with a selection of books, magazines and newspaper articles, relevant objects, and artefacts.

The players selected are from across the world and all are at different stages of their careers — from Aksa Nisar, a 17-year-old south Asian player in the early stages of her career, to Cheikhou Kouyaté, a Senegalese professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Crystal Palace, and Linvoy Primus MBE, an English former professional footballer who played for Portsmouth and Charlton Athletic FC.

Such events include the resurgence of Asian American hate since the pandemic, as well as the ongoing court case against affirmative action: “Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.” It is a mistake to assume, however, that Asians have been passive agents in these events. Many Asian Americans have taken part in activism—but have their voices been loud enough to be heard or have they been muffled amidst the magnitude of Asian American hate that renders racism against them invisible? Adding more layers to these issues is the way that the civil rights struggle creates solidarity within the Asian American community and other minoritized communities, but at the same time it has also fostered divisiveness both within Asian American communities and outside. How have ideas about immigration, stereotypes, and boundaries been both embraced and challenged by Asian Americans?</p><p>Needless to say, the problem of defending the civil rights of Asian Americans is a complex matter, one in which religion struggles to find its place. For this year’s conference, we ask what role religion holds in communicating and addressing these social and political issues? How do religious discourses, rituals, doctrines, and teachings serve Asian Americans in terms of defending their civil rights, as well as fostering group solidarity amidst the plurality of Asian American religious traditions? As scholars of Asian American religion, what is our role in this political discourse? How do we see Asian American civil rights movements and scholarship moving forward?</p><p>Scholars of all levels are invited to participate in this dialogue. Interested parties may send abstracts (250 words) to Shannon Toribio (<a href="mailto:shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu">shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu</a>) or Laura Snell (<a href="mailto:laurasnell@ucsb.edu">laurasnell@ucsb.edu</a>).

Recent years had seen expansions, contractions, and redefinitions of civil rights, with significant real-world effects for women, marginalized ethnic groups, sexual minorities, religious minorities, and people with disabilities, among others. Civil rights issues also speak to who we are as communities on the local, state, and international level, touching on fundamental questions of freedom and responsibility, sometimes calling for careful adjudication between conflicting claims and values.</p><p>● What lessons can be drawn from Jewish history and present-day dynamics?</p><p>● Where might Jewish tradition and Jewish thought offer unique insights?</p><p>● Where do American Jews fit within the broader conversations taking place among and between different faith communities in the United States?</p><p>● What are the most difficult aspects of this conversation for Jews and Jewish Studies scholars?</p><p>● How can we, as Jewish Studies scholars, bring our unique perspectives to bear on these topics?</p><p>The Jewish Studies Unit of the AAR-WR welcomes papers responding to any aspects of the above topics and questions, from all disciplines pertaining to the study of Jews and Judaism.</p><p><strong>The deadline for submissions is November 15, 2022.</strong></p><p><strong>The conference meets March 24-26, 2023, University of California, Davis, campus.</strong></p><p>Click here for the full conference theme for this year and previous years: <a href="https://www.aarwr.com/conference-themes.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.aarwr.com/conference-themes.html</a></p><p>Submissions should be sent to the Jewish Studies chairs – Roberta Sabbath (<a href="mailto:roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu">roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu</a>) and Alexander Marcus (<a href="mailto:alexander.marcus@yale.edu">alexander.marcus@yale.edu</a>) – and should include an abstract of 250 words as well as a Program Participant Form (<a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:b72795c0-e3c4-34a3-9715-e0b9400a0ac8" rel="nofollow">https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:b72795c0-e3c4...</a>), and a personal statement.</p><p>Contact Info: </p><p>Roberta Sabbath, Director Religious Studies Program, University of Nevada, Las Vegas</p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Roberta Sabbath, Director Religious Studies Program, University of Nevada, Las Vegas</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu">roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.aarwr.com/" target="_blank">https://www.aarwr.com/</a></div></div></div></description>

The growing interest in the practices and products of Islamic finance and the integration of Islamic finance with global economy is a major factor; however, it is not appropriate to attribute the surge in academic publications on the subjects of Islamic finance to this factor alone. Islamic economics, as an alternative domain of study that offers innovative tools and approaches in place of conventional teachings in the literature, deserves greater attention in not only the realm of practice but also of academy and theory. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>Interestingly, the concept of Islamic finance and economy takes greater attention in the West rather than predominantly Muslim countries. Even though there is visible interest in Islamic economy in such Muslim countries as Turkey, Malaysia, Iran and Malaysia, number and quality of academic studies in this field is far from being adequate and satisfactory. On the other hand, the Western academic circles, with the exception of some inherent prejudices and theological aloofness, are in pursuit of offering sincere answers to questions relevant to Islamic economic models and teachings. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>It should be noted, however, that the initial steps towards formulating an Islamic finance and economy should be taken in a Muslim country, Turkey being a major candidate. Despite that it has been a long time since the introduction of Islamic finance institutions, the academic circles in Turkey have failed to catch up and delayed to fill the gap. Laying down the theoretical framework of the Islamic finance institutions that have exhibited a trend of growth and popularity not only in Turkey but also in the world is a matter of urgency for the academic institutions and figures. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>This study seeks to address this problem and thus to offer an introductory account focusing on the subjects of Islamic finance and economics. There is visible need for such an account since there is no comprehensive literature that can be employed in courses being offered in courses on Islamic finance and economy. Additionally, there are not even much works of reference that can be consulted with by researchers who are in the initial phase of their studies. To this end, this work, an initiative that will address this gap by featuring a style of encyclopedia that holds a special place in Western academic tradition, collects and explains major concepts of Islamic finance and economics. The study that will present a solid framework for the elaboration of the major concepts of the subject will make use of the existing academic literature, as well as theological sources and the history of Islam and of Islamic financial practices. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>For this reason, this encyclopedia relies on an interdisciplinary approach. Even though in some instances will it give the impression that it is a study of economics literature, the volume will also make room for discussions of Islamic theology, history and philosophy. The goal in doing this is to present the historical theoretical framework as well as the modern and contemporary views and tendencies. From this perspective, this study makes a strong claim that it will serve as a reference work for those who are eager to conduct research on different aspects of Islamic finance and economics. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>This study primarily speaks to the academic community. Even though it could be considered an introductory effort for the academics who do research on Islamic finance, this volume presents an integrated and condensed account. The problems regarding eclecticism are persistent in different academic disciplines; but it is even more acute and pressing when it comes to the study of Islamic finance and economics. As a result, the researchers in most cases leave many issues out which thus make the outcome vague and imprecise in the literature. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>The encyclopedia of Islamic economics and finance compiles and features what could be worth being researched further in an integrated manner. Every single entry in the encyclopedia represents a wider area where further research can be employed. What the researchers are expected to do is to pick one, identify the potential correlations and overlaps between different subjects and to draw a roadmap accordingly. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><b><span><span>Timetable:</span></span></b></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>This work is to be completed in June 2023, as stipulated under the terms of a publication contract with Palgrave. The study features more than 400 entries, ranging from length of 500 to 5,000 words, depending on their significance. Even though a substantial part of the entries has already been solicited, there are still others open to expression of interest by the wider academic community.

In 1875 they had founded The Theosophical Society in New York, a spiritualist organisation that, by the 1900s, enjoyed a global presence and had turned Western esoteric quests to India and her two religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. Their quest led to radically new interpretations and uses of the religions which gave rise to a new, diverse and highly controversial body of knowledge on India as the proverbial Magical Orient. </span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><strong><span><span>About Dr Sugata Nandi </span></span></strong></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Dr Sugata Nandi is Assistant Professor of History at the West Bengal State University, Kolkata, India, where he teaches Modern Indian History, the Industrial Revolution, Western Historiography and Research Methodology.

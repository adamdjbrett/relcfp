						<description><p>The development of natural language models gives an opportunity to use AI-chatbots in religious discourse analysis, as well as to test them as possible theologians.</p>
<p>Many practical and philosophical questions arise on these grounds. Let us list out only a few of them. Are such chatbots really helpful in those analyses? Can they be really good logicians (if they don't "know" when they say true sentences) and good theologians (if they are not humans)? Can we train a model to make it operating like Thomas Aquinas (or at least some of his disciples)?</p>
<p>At this workshop we will collect results of such experiments which include <u>both theological and logical</u> perspective.</p>
<p>Topics may include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>testing theological and logical skills of AI-chatbots,</li>
<li>comparison of different AI-chatbots/AI-models with respect to such logical and theological skills,</li>

Following their lead, scholars in the past two decades have charted how <em>Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum </em>navigates intricate issues of gender, genre, patronage, courtly politics, religion, and poetic authority. This panel aims to expand this fruitful work by exploring new avenues for scholarship that consider Lanyer’s engagement with other contexts and discourses. Accordingly, this panel seeks papers that either examine new courses of inquiry or reevaluate established topics of Lanyer scholarship. Paper topics might include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embodiment or Humoralism</li>
<li>Sensation or Sensorium</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Ecology or Nature</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Classical Reception</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper title (15 words maximum)</li>
<li>Abstract (200 words maximum)</li>
<li>Brief CV (1 page maximum)</li>
<li>PhD or other terminal degree completion year (past or expected)</li>
<li>Full name, current affiliation, and e-mail address</li>

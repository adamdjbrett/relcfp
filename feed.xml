						<description>Publication Name: Violence and Conflict in Alexandre Kojève's works<br/><br/><p><strong>Call for Papers: Violence and Conflict in Alexandre Kojève’s works.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special issue of <em>The Philosophical Journal of Conflict and Violence</em> guest-edited by Luis Javier Pedrazuela</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Alexandre Kojève is well known for having initiated a whole generation of intellectuals into a certain reading of Hegel. His idea of the end of history has been linked by some of its popularizers to the expansion of liberal democracy around the globe. According to this version the western welfare order since 1945 owes to thinkers like Kojève a great part of its success all the more so because he worked for it in a practical manner from his post in the French ministry of economy. Whatever the truth of this version, the fact is that in its wake some essential aspects of Kojève´s thought become blunt, if not altogether disappear. These aspects refer to his treatment of conflict and violence and are worth an insightful reexamination.</p>
<p>From the claim that the struggle for recognition must be necessarily a “bloody” one to the assessment that the replacement of those elites whose authority has expired may call for their annihilation, not to mention his equation of biological “death” with human freedom or his interpretation of revolutionary terror as a pedagogical tool to bring forth the perfect citizen of the post-historical age, Kojève´s corpus offers not few topics in which to ground such a reexamination.</p>
<p>PJCV seeks cutting-age articles from contributors which openly explore the aforementioned topics as well as others along the same lines such as (although not restricted to):</p>
<p>1.     Morality, violence, and general will in Alexandre Kojève</p>
<p>2.     The merits and/or limitations of Kojève's interpretations on conflict and violence in Hegel's philosophy.</p>
<p>3.     Kojèvean interpretations of current social or international conflicts.</p>
<p>4.     The anti-political nature of Kojève´s End-State against the backdrop of Schmitt´s political decision.</p>
<p>5.     The Lacanian subject and the Kojèvean struggle to the death</p>
<p>6.     Alexandre Kojève and Vichy France.</p>
<p>7.     The Hegelian notion of “Bildung” in Alexandre Kojève.</p>
<p>8.     Stalinism and Kojève´s Universal and Homogeneous State.</p>
<p>9.     Conflict, violence, and Alexandre Kojève’s standpoint on the “intellectual”</p>
<p>10.  Pedagogy, authority, and propaganda in Kojève´s work</p>
<p>11.  The College of Sociology and the Kojèvean notions of exchange and distribution.</p>
<p>12.  Kojève´s anti-utopian bias.</p>
<p>13.  The Buddhist roots of Kojève´s “annihilation”</p>
<p>14.  The issue of the compatibility between Kojève's theory of the "end of history" and conflict and violence in the 21st century.</p>
<p>15.  Kojève and competing views on world history with respect to conflict and violence.</p>

These are ethnicity  and religion. Only in the 1993 Presidential election were the issues played down as Nigerians seemed comfortable with a Muslim/Muslim ticket that was presented by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as its Presidential and Vice-Presidential Candidates. Since the turn of the fourth republic, these two factors have continued to play prominent roles in shaping elections and electoral processes and victories in the country and they have been made more particularly important due to the influence of politicians who have always exploited these diversities to their own advantage. The year 2023 in particular is fundamentally crucial as it is monumental in the history of Nigeria. Apart from being an election year when the people will go to the polls to elect a new leader for the country after the current leader President Muhammadu Buhari would have completed the constitutionally guaranteed eight years for a President, it also marks the year when history seems on the verge of repeating itself. Without doubt, religion and ethnicity have returned and continued to be recurrent factors in the electoral process in Nigeria, however, in 2023, the stake seems to be higher.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span>The stake is higher in 2023 especially with various factors such as the North-South dichotomy (or what is sometimes referred to as rotational Presidency) in the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), same religion (Muslim-Muslim) tickets of the All Progressives Congress (APC) among others. The question arises whether the country should not have outgrown such diversities that have been holding the country down since independence and what becomes of the country’s democracy if these dichotomies are not checked.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Paper for Presentation are hereby invited to be submitted for a conference on the above stated theme scheduled to hold from 14th to 16th December, 2022. </span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><b><span><span>The Sub-themes include but are not limited to the following:</span></span></b></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Theoretical and Thematic Discussions on Nigeria’s Democracy</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Politics, Religion and Ethnicity in Nigeria</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Impact of Religion and Ethnicity on Nigeria’s Democracy</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>History of Democracy in Nigeria.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Religion, Ethnicity and Citizen’s Response.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Primary Elections and Intra-Party squabbles in Nigeria.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Gender Perspectives on Elections and Electoral Processes in Nigeria.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>The concept of Rotational Presidency and its Implications on Nigeria’s Democracy</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Power Rotation (Zoning) and Politics of Identity in Nigeria</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Restructuring, Power Domination and Power Devolution</span></span></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Dr. E.

In this session, project directors will reflect on the importance of cities in defining religion and religious space. This roundtable will offer insight into emergent and innovative models for the study of lived religion through new pedagogical frameworks, including active community inclusion in educational programming (including teacher institutes, university courses, and K-12 resources) and creating new historically and ethnographically informed publicly accessible museum exhibitions, oral history collections, and digital repositories of lived religious practice in the United States.Hyatt Regency-Mineral G (Third Level), Daisy Vargas, University of Arizona, Presiding</span></p><p><span><strong>Community Engaged Research: Lessons from the Good Life Project (Roundtable)</strong></span></p><p>This roundtable features five scholars from across the US who participated in the CRC at Morgan State University collaboration, “The Good Life Project,” launched in 2021. Scholars and activists working at the intersections of religion, theology, and forms of justice-centered work, documented how urban communities pursue justice and foster healthy relationships between themselves and their environment–a pursuit that is implicitly and explicitly informed by a history of mass atrocities, such as the extermination of Indigenous Peoples and American Slavery. The discussion will include overlapping concerns of the Project collaborators and scholars of genocide and mass atrocities–such as frameworks of mutual responsibility and care ethics among community members, institutions, non-human life, and land rights. Roundtable participants will also discuss the ethical standards of Community-Based Research processes that promote non-exploitative relationships. <span>Sunday, Nov. 20th 12:30 PM - 2:30 PM; Hyatt Regency-Mineral G (Third Level) Fatima Bamba, Presiding </span><em>Co-Sponsored with Religion, Genocide, and Holocaust</em></p><p><strong><em>The Religion &amp; Cities Business Meeting</em></strong> is open to all and will take place at 10:30am on Sunday, November 20th, 2022. </p><p><span>Rupa Pillai, University of Pennsylvania, Presiding<br/>Fatimah Fanusie, Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies, Presiding</span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Fatimah Fanusie and Rupa Pillai</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:fanusie@icjs.org">fanusie@icjs.org</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.religionandcities.org/aar" target="_blank">https://www.religionandcities.org/aar</a></div></div></div></description>

Broadly analyzing the history of Ottoman religious dynamics, the talk presents arguments for defining a Muslim priestly sodality. This corporate entity is identified through a considerable overlap between the Sufi and ulamaic functions, and is represented by state-appointed religious authorities. I further focus on the collective representations of <i>baraka, </i>often interpreted by the ulamaic circles as Allah’s grace. It was believed that religious professionals used <i>baraka</i> to cause wonders. Wonder-working, as the mechanical aspect of Ottoman Sunni Islam, was for the most part included by Sufi teachings and practices, which were therefore integral to Ottoman Sunnism. Most prominent Sufi masters and their disciples formed a part of the institutionalized priestly sodality networks that were present in the region. Ottoman religious professionals over time made doctrinal and social distinctions between their own thaumaturgical (wonder-working) beliefs and practices, and those commonly interpreted as magic (<i>siḥr</i>). Although conceptually and anthropologically congruent, thaumaturgy and magic retained their distinctive character until the modern reforms and beyond. Looking into the thin line between wonder-working and magic allows for rich socio-anthropological discussions about the relationships between religion and magic in history, which represents another main point of my presentation.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:panticn@ceu.edu">panticn@ceu.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

Scholars have employed a variety of terms to describe such moments of convergence, including “hybridity,” “creolization,” “syncretism,” “eclecticism,” and even “fuzziness.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In 2009, historians Sünne Juterczenka and Gesa Mackenthun used the mathematical concept of “fuzzy logic” as a framework for examining the entanglements, ambiguities, and mutual impacts resulting from interactions between multiple cultures. “Fuzzy logic” argues for the presence of multiple truth values on a spectrum from absolute truth to falsehood. It allows for the exploration of blurred boundaries and the diffusion of practices. More recently, art historian Holly Schafer employs the term “eclecticism” to describe intercultural objects whose disparate elements retain their independence while creating a new form. Broadly defined as a practice inspired by a multiplicity of cultural, artistic, and stylistic sources, eclecticism provides a way of thinking about the intercultural nature of the pre-modern world. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Building on these concepts, the Pre/Early Modern Forum invites graduate students working in the humanities to explore all things “eclectic” and “fuzzy” that complicate cultural and geographical boundaries in the pre-1800 world. We encourage submissions from all geographical distinctions, especially those that explore topics related to East Asia. Interrogating the ways in which intercultural encounters blur and maintain boundaries, the conference aims to foster creative and innovative dialogue across cultures, regions, time periods, and disciplines. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Contact zones, intersectionality, and peripheries</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Movement of objects, people, and ideas across boundaries </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Authorship and ownership</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Translation and transcription</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Religious proselytization and conversion</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Micro-histories addressing specific instances of encounter</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Gift exchange, diplomacy, and trade</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Technology and methodology</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Patronage and collecting</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Power dynamics within systems of colonialism </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Identity formation and articulation </span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Interested participants are invited to submit an abstract of no more than 300 words, along with a short biography, to </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="mailto:yalepem@gmail.com"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>yalepemf@gmail.com</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> by </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Monday, January 2, 2023</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.

Privately, some Jews expressed fear that antisemitism might derail COR if the organization was seen as “too Jewish.” This paper explores what Jews’ involvement with COR – and attempts to perhaps downplay their own role - reveals about Jewish humanitarian efforts, Jewish identity, and religious activism versus religiously-influenced activism.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Respondent: </span></span></span><span><span><span>Shana Bernstein, Northwestern University</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This event is free, but all participants must register in advance and space is limited.

If I do not reach deep into moral imagination and envision a world beyond the supremacist, nationalistic, and oppressive culture in which I live, then I have sacrificed my principles and embarrassed my calling as a minister of the gospel.</em><br/>– Frank A. Thomas,<br/><em>How to Preach a Dangerous Sermon</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Rhetoric is indeed, as many theologians feared,</em> <em>risky and messy</em>.<br/>– Majorie O’Rourke Boyle,<br/>“Rhetorical Theology: Charity Seeking Charity”</p><p>~</p><p>In <em>Life’s Too Short to Pretend You’re Not Religious</em>, David Dark observes that religion — and we’d add rhetoric — “is the question of how we dispose our energies, how we see fit to organize our own lives and, in many cases, the lives of others.” Majorie O’Rourke Boyle nicely captures the contingency of such a claim when she notes that rhetoric — and we’d add religion — is risky and messy. Religion and rhetoric coalesce around virtually every human concern, which is why we feel compelled to open this call for papers asking what roles religious rhetorics, and rhetorics of religion more generally, play in helping us to “envision a world beyond the supremacist, nationalistic, and oppressive culture” that Frank Thomas calls out in <em>How To Preach a Dangerous Sermon</em>? It’s a perennial question, of course, but as scholarship that interrogates the intersections of rhetoric and religion continues to proliferate, Thomas reminds us of the role religious rhetorics play in cultivating communities of resistance, especially ones that can rise to the challenge of imagining a more hopeful and just future starting in the present.</p><p>We invite scholars to submit individual or coauthored paper and panel proposals focusing on any project related to rhetoric and religion, but we are especially interested in work that helps us imagine the resources that can be cultivated from the study of religious rhetorics, whether those resources are pedagogical, philosophical, homiletic, activist-focused, or something else.</p><p>As with the previous <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/utk.edu/rhetoric-and-religion/" rel="nofollow">Rhetoric &amp; Religious Traditions</a> conference that took place in 2018, presenters might examine the intersections between work on religious rhetorics and other subfields of communication studies, rhetoric and writing studies, religious studies, homiletics, sociology, anthropology, or other fields that engage with the philosophy of language and communication. Presenters might discuss the ways scholarship on religion and rhetoric might be invigorated by studying spiritual traditions and practices of particular groups. Other researchers might examine the ways scholarship on rhetoric and religion can help us explore key cultural concerns in our current moment, including how problems like the ones Thomas names — things like white supremacy, xenophobia, and misinformation — can be engaged using the resources of particular rhetorical and religious traditions.</p><p>Importantly, we also want to make space for work that is anti-religious, non-religious, or takes a critical perspective on religious rhetoric. We wish to cultivate an interdisciplinary space that welcomes believers, skeptics, atheists, activists, scholars, and religious leaders. We especially hope scholars doing work on non-Western religious traditions will consider submitting a proposal.</p><p>We welcome Single Paper and Full Panel (3-4 speakers) proposals. Please limit Single Paper proposals to 250 words and Full Panel Proposals to 500 words. For Full Panel proposals, please include the names/email addresses of each speaker.</p><p>Please submit proposals via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMkl30ZuAHbQyLnm30Fv47SUt-EEA29P58GVy1xTUEV7Cz3Q/viewform" rel="nofollow"><strong>submission link</strong></a> by March 15, 2023.</p><p>Inquires can be sent to Dr. Will Duffy and Dr. Andre E.

While the trend of recent years has often suggested that different approaches to philosophical problems can be adequately categorized, using the dichotomy of purely systematic or purely historical interests, Whitehead offers an equally historically informed and systematically intended perspective.</p>
<p>This conference is dedicated to the philosophical-historical dimension in Whitehead’s oeuvre on the one hand and to its systematic relevance for numerous areas of research on the other hand.</p>
<p>Interested scholars are cordially invited to submit an abstract of no more than 500 words<br/>in one of the follwoing sections here: <a href="https://easychair.org/account/signin?l=8DUhKbvT0vCoX6K2LRHeX4">https://easychair.org/account/signin?l=8DUhKbvT0vCoX6K2LRHeX4</a></p>

The players selected are from across the world and all are at different stages of their careers — from Aksa Nisar, a 17-year-old south Asian player in the early stages of her career, to Cheikhou Kouyaté, a Senegalese professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Crystal Palace, and Linvoy Primus MBE, an English former professional footballer who played for Portsmouth and Charlton Athletic FC.

Such events include the resurgence of Asian American hate since the pandemic, as well as the ongoing court case against affirmative action: “Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.” It is a mistake to assume, however, that Asians have been passive agents in these events. Many Asian Americans have taken part in activism—but have their voices been loud enough to be heard or have they been muffled amidst the magnitude of Asian American hate that renders racism against them invisible? Adding more layers to these issues is the way that the civil rights struggle creates solidarity within the Asian American community and other minoritized communities, but at the same time it has also fostered divisiveness both within Asian American communities and outside. How have ideas about immigration, stereotypes, and boundaries been both embraced and challenged by Asian Americans?</p><p>Needless to say, the problem of defending the civil rights of Asian Americans is a complex matter, one in which religion struggles to find its place. For this year’s conference, we ask what role religion holds in communicating and addressing these social and political issues? How do religious discourses, rituals, doctrines, and teachings serve Asian Americans in terms of defending their civil rights, as well as fostering group solidarity amidst the plurality of Asian American religious traditions? As scholars of Asian American religion, what is our role in this political discourse? How do we see Asian American civil rights movements and scholarship moving forward?</p><p>Scholars of all levels are invited to participate in this dialogue. Interested parties may send abstracts (250 words) to Shannon Toribio (<a href="mailto:shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu">shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu</a>) or Laura Snell (<a href="mailto:laurasnell@ucsb.edu">laurasnell@ucsb.edu</a>).

Recent years had seen expansions, contractions, and redefinitions of civil rights, with significant real-world effects for women, marginalized ethnic groups, sexual minorities, religious minorities, and people with disabilities, among others. Civil rights issues also speak to who we are as communities on the local, state, and international level, touching on fundamental questions of freedom and responsibility, sometimes calling for careful adjudication between conflicting claims and values.</p><p>● What lessons can be drawn from Jewish history and present-day dynamics?</p><p>● Where might Jewish tradition and Jewish thought offer unique insights?</p><p>● Where do American Jews fit within the broader conversations taking place among and between different faith communities in the United States?</p><p>● What are the most difficult aspects of this conversation for Jews and Jewish Studies scholars?</p><p>● How can we, as Jewish Studies scholars, bring our unique perspectives to bear on these topics?</p><p>The Jewish Studies Unit of the AAR-WR welcomes papers responding to any aspects of the above topics and questions, from all disciplines pertaining to the study of Jews and Judaism.</p><p><strong>The deadline for submissions is November 15, 2022.</strong></p><p><strong>The conference meets March 24-26, 2023, University of California, Davis, campus.</strong></p><p>Click here for the full conference theme for this year and previous years: <a href="https://www.aarwr.com/conference-themes.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.aarwr.com/conference-themes.html</a></p><p>Submissions should be sent to the Jewish Studies chairs – Roberta Sabbath (<a href="mailto:roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu">roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu</a>) and Alexander Marcus (<a href="mailto:alexander.marcus@yale.edu">alexander.marcus@yale.edu</a>) – and should include an abstract of 250 words as well as a Program Participant Form (<a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:b72795c0-e3c4-34a3-9715-e0b9400a0ac8" rel="nofollow">https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:b72795c0-e3c4...</a>), and a personal statement.</p><p>Contact Info: </p><p>Roberta Sabbath, Director Religious Studies Program, University of Nevada, Las Vegas</p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Roberta Sabbath, Director Religious Studies Program, University of Nevada, Las Vegas</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu">roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.aarwr.com/" target="_blank">https://www.aarwr.com/</a></div></div></div></description>

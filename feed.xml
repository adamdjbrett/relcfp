			<title>[ June 3, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: University of Leeds Graduate Political Theory Conference 2024 - Digital Capitalism: Beyond the Neoliberal Paradigm?</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/118045</link>
						<description><p><u>University of Leeds Graduate Political Theory Conference 2024</u></p>
<p><u>Hosted by the Centre of Contemporary Political Theory </u></p>
<p><u>Call for Papers.</u></p>
<p><u>Digital Capitalism: Beyond the Neoliberal Paradigm?</u></p>
<p>Digital capitalism is the defining system of the early 21st century. As evidenced by the rise in immaterial labour, digital markets, and widespread surveillance, collection and commodification of personal data, more and more of our daily interactions fall under digital capitalism’s totalising claws. Mainstream critiques of digital capitalism have tended to interpret digital capitalism as an exclusively neoliberal project. This conference challenges these mainstream critiques and asks what it would mean to think about digital capitalism beyond the neoliberal paradigm. In <em>Capital is Dead, </em>Mackenzie Wark famously proclaimed: “This is not capitalism anymore; it is something worse”. Building on this proclamation, we invite papers that explore how digital capitalism is developing into something new, something beyond neoliberalism. The purpose of the conference is to examine how new theories/ideas/approaches can help us to understand an emerging new formulation of digital capitalism that standard critiques of neoliberalism cannot adequately capture.</p>
<p>We welcome papers from various theoretical backgrounds, approaches, and perspectives in political theory. Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>·      Critiques of digital capitalism that move beyond a neoliberal understanding such as decolonial, postcolonial, feminist, queer, neo-feudal, and technocratic feudalism critiques of digital capitalism, are of keen interest; </p>
<p>·      Novel interpretations of the commons and digital commons in digital capitalism; </p>
<p>·      Structural and post-structural theories that elaborate on reproductive processes of digital capitalism that go beyond a neoliberal understanding; </p>
<p>·      Specific critiques of types of digital media that reproduce structures, subjectivity, and ideologies that do not fit a neoliberal paradigm;</p>
<p>·      New democratic problems, solutions, or benefits associated with a developing non-neoliberal digital capitalism. </p>
<p>Keynote Speaker: Associate Professor Dr Kylie Jarrett </p>
<p>Associate Professor Kylie Jarrett is a renowned scholar whose expertise covers user experiences of social media, the politics of the commercial Web, online sexuality, and gender issues relating to work in digital media industries and the platform economy. Jarrett has (co)-authored four books: <em>Digital Labor</em> (Polity, 2022), <em>#NSFW: Sex, Humor and Risk in Social Media</em> (MIT Press, 2019), <em>Feminism, Labour and Digital Media: The Digital Housewife</em> (Routledge, 2016), <em>Google and the Culture of Search</em> (Routledge, 2013). Jarrett, Susanna Paasonen and Ben Light's <em>#NSFW: Sex, Humor and Risk in Social Media </em>(MIT Press, 2019) won the 2020 Association of Internet Researchers book award. Jarrett is editor-in-chief of a new SAGE journal, <em>Dialogues in Digital Societies</em>.</p>
<p>The submission deadline is 1st March 2024. Please submit your 200-300 word abstract prepared for anonymous review to uolpoltheorygradconfernce2024@gmail.com. We ask you to include your information (full name, position/affiliation, contact details) in a separate document. Applicants will be informed of the decision regarding their proposal by 31st March 2024.</p>
<p>The conference participants will have the opportunity to self-nominate their papers for participation in this year’s Graduate Political Theory Conference/BJPIR Collaboration project. This project aims to develop up to two promising papers presented at the 2024 Graduate Political Theory Conference for submission to <em>The British Journal of Politics and International Relations </em>(BJPIR).<em> </em>Authors of the two selected papers will receive mentorship from a member of the <em>BJPIR</em><em> </em>editorial team.

			<title>[ June 3, 2024] Conference or similar: University of Leeds Graduate Political Theory Conference 2024 - Digital Capitalism: Beyond the Neoliberal Paradigm?</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/118041</link>
						<description>Venue: Woodhouse Lane<br/><br/><p><u>University of Leeds Graduate Political Theory Conference 2024</u></p>
<p><u>Hosted by the Centre of Contemporary Political Theory </u></p>
<p><u>Call for Papers.</u></p>
<p><u>Digital Capitalism: Beyond the Neoliberal Paradigm?</u></p>
<p>Digital capitalism is the defining system of the early 21st century. As evidenced by the rise in immaterial labour, digital markets, and widespread surveillance, collection and commodification of personal data, more and more of our daily interactions fall under digital capitalism’s totalising claws. Mainstream critiques of digital capitalism have tended to interpret digital capitalism as an exclusively neoliberal project. This conference challenges these mainstream critiques and asks what it would mean to think about digital capitalism beyond the neoliberal paradigm. In <em>Capital is Dead, </em>Mackenzie Wark famously proclaimed: “This is not capitalism anymore; it is something worse”. Building on this proclamation, we invite papers that explore how digital capitalism is developing into something new, something beyond neoliberalism. The purpose of the conference is to examine how new theories/ideas/approaches can help us to understand an emerging new formulation of digital capitalism that standard critiques of neoliberalism cannot adequately capture.</p>
<p>We welcome papers from various theoretical backgrounds, approaches, and perspectives in political theory. Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>·      Critiques of digital capitalism that move beyond a neoliberal understanding such as decolonial, postcolonial, feminist, queer, neo-feudal, and technocratic feudalism critiques of digital capitalism, are of keen interest; </p>
<p>·      Novel interpretations of the commons and digital commons in digital capitalism; </p>
<p>·      Structural and post-structural theories that elaborate on reproductive processes of digital capitalism that go beyond a neoliberal understanding; </p>
<p>·      Specific critiques of types of digital media that reproduce structures, subjectivity, and ideologies that do not fit a neoliberal paradigm;</p>
<p>·      New democratic problems, solutions, or benefits associated with a developing non-neoliberal digital capitalism. </p>

<p>Keynote Speaker: Associate Professor Dr Kylie Jarrett </p>
<p>Associate Professor Kylie Jarrett is a renowned scholar whose expertise covers user experiences of social media, the politics of the commercial Web, online sexuality, and gender issues relating to work in digital media industries and the platform economy. Jarrett has (co)-authored four books: <em>Digital Labor</em> (Polity, 2022), <em>#NSFW: Sex, Humor and Risk in Social Media</em> (MIT Press, 2019), <em>Feminism, Labour and Digital Media: The Digital Housewife</em> (Routledge, 2016), <em>Google and the Culture of Search</em> (Routledge, 2013). Jarrett, Susanna Paasonen and Ben Light's <em>#NSFW: Sex, Humor and Risk in Social Media </em>(MIT Press, 2019) won the 2020 Association of Internet Researchers book award. Jarrett is editor-in-chief of a new SAGE journal, <em>Dialogues in Digital Societies</em>.</p>

<p>The submission deadline is 1st March 2024. Please submit your 200-300 word abstract prepared for anonymous review to uolpoltheorygradconfernce2024@gmail.com. We ask you to include your information (full name, position/affiliation, contact details) in a separate document.

<p>We are pleased to announce the launch of a new eJournal dedicated to exploring ‘live’ issues in theology. This platform aims to foster intellectual discourse and provide a space for theologians of various stripes in Ireland to share their insights and perspectives on the evolving landscape of theological studies. Theology has always been a dynamic field, constantly adapting to the challenges and questions posed by society and culture.</p>
<p>Our launch edition will explore the future of theology and identify some of the ‘live’ questions that demand our attention. We invite short contributions from scholars, students, and researchers across various disciplines, including theology, philosophy, religious studies, sociology, history, literature, anthropology, and beyond. We encourage submissions that critically engage with the future of theology, addressing questions such as:</p>
<p>1. How can theology respond to the changing religious landscape in an increasingly secular world?</p>
<p>2. What role can theology play in addressing future social, political, and environmental challenges?</p>
<p>3. How can theology contribute to interfaith dialogue in a diverse global society?</p>
<p>4. How can theology incorporate emerging technologies and scientific advancements into its discourse?</p>
<p>5. How can theology engage with contemporary ethical dilemmas and contribute to moral decision-making in the future?</p>
<p>6. How can theology interact with other disciplines?</p>
<p>Contributions should be original and innovative, offering fresh perspectives and insights into the future of theology. We welcome theoretical and empirical approaches and interdisciplinary studies that bridge the gap between theology and other kinds of knowledge. We also welcome poetry, creative writing, journal entries, book reviews, and artwork.</p>
<p>Submissions should be a maximum of 1,000 words. Accepted papers will be published in the inaugural issue of the journal. The deadline for submissions is 4th March 2024. Please submit your papers via email to <a href="mailto:cairntheologyproject@outlook.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cairntheologyproject@outlook.com</a>. Include your full name, institutional affiliation (if applicable), a photograph, and a brief biography (100 words max) with your submission.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your contributions and engaging in a thought-provoking dialogue on the future of theology.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Cairn Project Team.</p>

<p>Southeast Regional Conference on Christianity and Literature Covenant College<br/>Lookout Mountain, GA<br/>October 10-12, 2024</p>
<p>Keynote Speaker: Malcolm Guite (Poet and President of the George MacDonald Society)</p>
<p>To commemorate the bicentenary of George MacDonald--the nineteenth-century Scottish novelist, fantasist, theologian, and poet--this conference welcomes papers pertaining to his life, work, and legacy. More broadly, we invite papers that explore motifs of childlikeness, particularly as they relate to faith and imagination. MacDonald’s children’s stories, such as The Princess and the Goblin, The Golden Key, and The Light Princess, remain a favorite with fantasy readers of all ages, and MacDonald insists that he writes not “for children, but for the childlike, whether of five, or fifty, or seventy-five.” In fact, his interest in childlikeness pervades his creative and theological output, resurfacing in his realistic fiction, essays, and elsewhere. Human hearts, he recommends, “should always be growing younger.”</p>
<p>The child is a complexly evocative figure in scripture, literature, and culture. Christ exhorts his disciples to become like little children, and scripture abounds with imagery of God’s people as beloved, obedient, and dependent children. Conversely, Proverbs recommends strategies for curbing childish folly, and Paul encourages the Corinthians to put aside childish ways. While literature sometimes romanticizes childhood as a time of innocence, imagination, and endless potential, it also depicts the vulnerability, waywardness, and ignorance of children. Bildungsromane focus on the transition from childhood to adulthood as both a linear and a recursive process. Young Adult fiction enjoys popularity among adult readers, but suffers criticism from the literary elite. Narratives of secularization often characterize dissociation from religion as a cultural coming of age, while postsecularity might be construed as a return to former openness. Humans, it seems, wrestle with simultaneous desires for maturity and for childlikeness, and such internal conflict constitutes a suggestive analogue to the interplay between doubt and faith. Literature offers a medium for this wrestling, as well as imaginative alternatives to the false dichotomy between maturity and childlikeness. We welcome papers and creative works that address any aspect of this conversation, with possible topics including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p> George MacDonald’s novels, fairy tales, poetry, sermons, essays, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  MacDonald’s Romantic precursors, literary peers, or twentieth and twenty-first-century</p>
<p>successors (for instance, the Inklings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Children’s literature and literary depictions of childhood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  The role of literature in child rearing, pedagogy, or spiritual formation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Bildungsroman narratives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>  Fantasy and mythopoesis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Themes of rebirth and restoration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Sacred, secular, and post-secular accounts of childhood and maturation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Retrospective, recursive, or otherwise non-linear narratives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  The competition, coexistence, and/or conversation between faith and doubt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  The role of liturgy as return and renewal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Recovery: literature that bestows fresh or clarified vision; literature that recovers lost or</p>
<p>marginalized voices; literature that anticipates new creation</p>
<p>Other proposals concerning the relationship of Christianity and literature, including panel proposals and creative works, are welcome. Presenters should be members of the Conference on Christianity and Literature by the time of the conference.</p>
<p>Submit abstracts of 250-300 words by July 15, 2024, to Dr. Heather Hess, <a href="mailto:heather.hess@covenant.edu">heather.hess@covenant.edu</a>. Undergraduate students must submit their entire paper for consideration; eligible undergraduate papers will be entered into the national CCL Undergraduate Writing Contest for a cash prize. Graduate students accepted to the conference are encouraged to apply for the CCL Conference Travel Grant.</p>

<p>Edited Collection:  <em>Magic, Horror, and the Reproductive Body in Popular Culture</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monstrous mothers have been a pop culture staple since Beowulf and remain a perennial concern of the Gothic, horror, and its scholarship to this day. In this volume, we move beyond fantastical motherhood to interrogate the politics of birth and reproduction in all its forms precisely at the intersection of magic and horror. Taking our cues from the AHSN 2023 symposium ‘Magic and Horror’ we are seeking proposals for chapters of 4000 to 7000 words for a collected edition to be published with the Routledge Advances in Popular Culture series (series editor Prof. Piatti-Farnell). Contributions should examine combinations of reproduction, magic, and horror in a range of mediums. ‘Magic’ may be understood broadly as is appropriate to the relevant cultural context but might include spells, enchantment, voodoo, ritual, superpowers, and even fantastic technologies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>-        Biopower and the politics of reproduction</p>
<p>-        Reproductive futurity</p>
<p>-        Birth rates and (dis)enchanting childhoods</p>
<p>-        Superheroes, superpowers, and abject motherhood</p>
<p>-        Witch mothers</p>
<p>-        Reproduction and immortality: the moral imperative of death</p>
<p>-        Horror and deviant babies</p>
<p>-        Medical intervention and the birthing body</p>
<p>-        Recounting maternal discourse in popular culture: missed chances?</p>
<p>-        Necropolitics</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Please send enquiries and abstracts (300 words) by March 2024 to collection editor Dr. Barratt-Peacock (University of Huddersfield) at: <a href="mailto:rbarrattpeacock@gmail.com">rbarrattpeacock@gmail.com</a></p>

The deadline for proposals is <strong>August 1, 2023</strong>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Area creates a wide net to examine the intersection of religion/ myth/fairy tale/ folklore in popular American and global culture. “Religion” here is not limited to institutionalized expressions or formal practices but also encompasses the interface with popular culture of religion as a range of beliefs and practices, identities and narratives that also find expression in performances and performative spaces (theater), in forms of music, art, dance, and film. Myth, Fairy Tale, and Folklore are similarly expansive concepts and, like Religion, cut across geographical and chronological boundaries.  Papers may be drawn from a range of disciplines and methodologies and papers that express new conceptualizations of the area themes are also welcome.</p>
<p>Themes in some recent papers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folk religion and non-mainstream practices</li>
<li>Religious themes in adolescent literature</li>
<li>Folkloric beliefs and practices evidenced in popular culture</li>
<li>Religious themes in American politics and popular media (TV)</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers that address the intersection of religion/ belief/ folk motifs and politics (across time and geographies) are especially welcome.</p>
<p>If you have questions about this area, please reach out to the Folklore, Belief and Religion Chair: June-Ann Greeley, PhD - Sacred Heart University at <a href="mailto:greeleyj@sacredheart.edu">greeleyj@sacredheart.edu</a></p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://nepca.blog/2023-annual-conference/">Conference Page</a> for more information about the conference, submission of abstracts and registration.</p>
<p>The deadline for the submission of abstracts is <strong>August 1, 2023</strong>.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeO-F5k26QxGQC08UY2E9axop4CCMoi3gNXqUhCPjD0EodjUA/viewform">Please use this form</a>. </p>

<p>Description
</p><p>In the 1823 US Supreme Court decision, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/21us543"><em>Johnson v M'Intosh</em></a>, Chief Justice John Marshall wrote,"...discovery gave title to government...[and] the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives." This decision underpins US property law. Marshall's deliberate use of the word "discovery" is an intentional reference to 15th Century Catholic Papal Bulls, which stated that any Christian who "discovers" a land populated by non-Christians has superior title, or rights of ownership, over that land. In essence, <em>Johnson</em> codifies into US law the principle of Euro-Christian domination over Indigenous Peoples. In the most devastating sense, the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (DoCD) legitimized exploitation, extraction, and enslavement globally and enshrined these practices as the basis of U.S. property law still cited today as recently as 2005 (in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/03-855"><em>Sherrill v. Oneida</em></a>) and 2020 (<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/18-9526"><em>McGirt v. Oklahoma</em></a>).</p>
<p>In the 200th year of <em>Johnson</em>, there is an urgent need for global recognition of the decision's implications as reifying the DoCD and its exploitation of Indigenous Peoples and their connection to land, regarded as a living being (Mother Earth in English.) This conference builds on the history of collaboration at Syracuse University with Indigenous communities across Central New York by expanding dissemination of the pernicious ideologies of DOCD and <em>Johnson</em>, leading to further repudiation of these ideologies and towards healing and repair.</p>
<p>The project's key collaborators include <a href="https://syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>, <a href="https://aila.ngo/">American Indian Law Alliance (AILA)</a>, <a href="https://indigenousvalues.org/">Indigenous Values Initiative (IVI)</a>, The <a href="https://www.skanonhcenter.org/">Skä-noñh -- Great Law of Peace Center</a>, and others.

			<title>[ December 8, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: The Religious Origins of White Supremacy: Johnson v. M’Intosh and the Doctrine of Christian Discovery.</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/112894</link>
						<description><p>Details</p>
<ul>
<li>The conference will take place at Syracuse University from 8-10 December 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sponsored by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Henry Luce Foundation</li>
<li>Syracuse University</li>
</ul>
<p>Description</p>
<p>In the 1823 US Supreme Court decision, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/21us543"><em>Johnson v M'Intosh</em></a>, Chief Justice John Marshall wrote,"...discovery gave title to government...[and] the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives." This decision underpins US property law. Marshall's deliberate use of the word "discovery" is an intentional reference to 15th Century Catholic Papal Bulls, which stated that any Christian who "discovers" a land populated by non-Christians has superior title, or rights of ownership, over that land. In essence, <em>Johnson</em> codifies into US law the principle of Euro-Christian domination over Indigenous Peoples. In the most devastating sense, the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (DoCD) legitimized exploitation, extraction, and enslavement globally and enshrined these practices as the basis of U.S. property law still cited today as recently as 2005 (in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/03-855"><em>Sherrill v. Oneida</em></a>) and 2020 (<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/18-9526"><em>McGirt v. Oklahoma</em></a>).</p>
<p>In the 200th year of <em>Johnson</em>, there is an urgent need for global recognition of the decision's implications as reifying the DoCD and its exploitation of Indigenous Peoples and their connection to land, regarded as a living being (Mother Earth in English.) This conference builds on the history of collaboration at Syracuse University with Indigenous communities across Central New York by expanding dissemination of the pernicious ideologies of DOCD and <em>Johnson</em>, leading to further repudiation of these ideologies and towards healing and repair.</p>
<p>The project's key collaborators include <a href="https://syracuse.edu/">Syracuse University</a>, <a href="https://aila.ngo/">American Indian Law Alliance (AILA)</a>, <a href="https://indigenousvalues.org/">Indigenous Values Initiative (IVI)</a>, The <a href="https://www.skanonhcenter.org/">Skä-noñh -- Great Law of Peace Center</a>, and others.

			<title>[ May 14, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: CPR2024: The Problem of Evil in Modern and Islamic Thought</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/119662</link>
						<description><p>The fact of many kinds of evil and calamities has always been a problem for theists, and they have tried to check whether there is a conflict between the reality of evil and their knowledge of God, according to the attributes they know about God. Among the atheists, this issue has been considered as evidence for the confirmation of atheism. Many thinkers in the contemporary era have dealt with this issue and have tried to answer this question and face this issue with the support of their intellectual foundations. The philosophy of religion, on the one hand, is responsible for investigating the philosophical validity of these questions. On the other hand, it is committed to evaluating the answers to this question and various encounters with it. The twelfth annual conference on the contemporary philosophy of religion tries to show what unexpected confrontations can arise by looking at the problem of evil from new angles. What is the relationship between the different Western encounters on this issue and Islamic attitudes?</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to the following:</p>
<p>-         Different Concepts of Evil and their relation to the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Different Notions of Divine Attributes Regarding the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Different Explanations of Afflictions and Their Relation to God</p>
<p>-         Evaluation of the Logical Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Evaluation of Evidential Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         The Problem of Evil and Islamic Philosophers</p>
<p>-         The Problem of Evil and The Doctrines of Qur’ān and Ḥadiṯh</p>
<p>-         The Difference between Abrahamic and Non-Abrahamic Religions Regarding the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Different Approaches of <em>Kalam </em>Schools Encountering the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Neo-Ṣadrāian Approaches Toward the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Evaluation of Death as an Evil for Humans and Animals</p>
<p>-         Different Explanations of Human Suffering (Existential Attitude) and its relation to God</p>
<p>-         Evils as a Justifier for atheism</p>
<p>-         Evils and Theism in Literature</p>
<p>-         Evils and Theism in Art</p>
<p>-         Evils and Theism in Scientific Analytics</p>

			<title>[ May 14, 2024 -  May 15, 2024] Conference or similar: CPR2024: The Problem of Evil in Modern and Islamic Thought</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/119658</link>
						<description>Venue: Shahid Behesthi University<br/><br/><p>The presence of various forms of evil and disasters has long posed a challenge for believers, prompting them to examine whether there is a conflict between the existence of evil and their understanding of God's attributes. Conversely, atheists have often viewed this issue as supporting evidence for their stance. In modern times, numerous thinkers have grappled with this dilemma, seeking to provide answers grounded in their intellectual frameworks. The field of philosophy of religion is tasked with both exploring the philosophical implications of these questions and assessing the responses they elicit. The twelfth annual conference on the contemporary philosophy of religion (CPR2024) aims to shed light on new perspectives by exploring the problem of evil from novel angles, highlighting unexpected encounters. It also seeks to examine the relationship between Western approaches to this issue and Islamic perspectives.</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not restricted to the following:</p>
<p>-         Different Concepts of Evil and their relation to the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Different Notions of Divine Attributes Regarding the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Different Explanations of Afflictions and Their Relation to God</p>
<p>-         Evaluation of the Logical Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Evaluation of Evidential Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         The Problem of Evil and Islamic Philosophers</p>
<p>-         The Problem of Evil and The Doctrines of Qur’ān and Ḥadiṯh</p>
<p>-         The Difference between Abrahamic and Non-Abrahamic Religions Regarding the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Different Approaches of <em>Kalam </em>Schools Encountering the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Neo-Ṣadrāian Approaches Toward the Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Evaluation of Death as an Evil for Humans and Animals</p>
<p>-         Different Explanations of Human Suffering (Existential Attitude) and its relation to God</p>
<p>-         Evils as a Justifier for atheism</p>
<p>-         Evils and Theism in Literature</p>
<p>-         Evils and Theism in Art</p>
<p>-         Evils and Theism in Scientific Analytics</p>
<p>-         Cinema and The Problem of Evil</p>
<p>-         Evils as Justifier for Meaninglessness of Life</p>

			<title>[ June 1, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: 8th Annual Theistic Ethics Workshop</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/119446</link>
						<description><p>Goal: Contemporary philosophy of religion has been richly informed by important work in metaphysics and epistemology. At the same time, there has not been nearly as much work done at the intersection of philosophy of religion and meta-ethics or normative theory. To help inspire more good work in this area, Christian Miller (Wake Forest), Mark Murphy (Georgetown), and Chris Tucker (William &amp; Mary) have been organizing a series of annual workshops on theistic ethics for a number of years.</p>
<p>Logistics: The eighth workshop will be held at the campus of Georgetown University. We will begin with dinner and the first paper on Thursday, September 26 and conclude at the end of the day on Saturday, September 28, 2024. There will be five invited papers and four spots for submitted papers. All papers have 40 minutes for presentation and at least 40 minutes for discussion.</p>
<p>Themes: “Theistic ethics” is to be understood broadly to include such topics as divine command and divine will theories, God and natural law, ethics and the problem of evil, moral arguments for a theistic being, infused and acquired virtues, the harms and benefits of theistic religions, specific ethical issues in Judaism, Christianity, or Islam, and many other topics as well.</p>
<p>Applying: Those interested in participating should submit an abstract of up to 750 words and a current C.V. to Mark Murphy at Mark.Murphy@georgetown.edu by June 1, 2024. Word or PDF file formats only. Please prepare abstracts for anonymous review.  For although the organizers seek to have a balanced program both in terms of topics and presenters, the initial stage of review will be done anonymously. Submitters to a previous year’s workshop, whether successful or unsuccessful, are welcome to apply to this year’s workshop.</p>
<p>Notification will be made by June 17, 2024. If your abstract is selected, we will cover all of your expenses for the workshop, including travel (this includes international travel). Co-authors are welcome, but only one author’s expenses can be covered. You do not have to send your paper in advance of the workshop, and it certainly can be a work in progress.  Questions about the workshop should be sent to Mark.Murphy@georgetown.edu.</p>
<p>Supported by generous funding from the Robert L. McDevitt, K.S.G., K.C.H.S and Catherine H. McDevitt, L.C.H.S. Chair in Religious Philosophy</p></description>

The self-reflexive matrix of popular culture’s representations of human body functions as a site for materializing possibilities of varying forms of living. As a cultural sign, body features in both normative and non-normative debates on identity, selfhood, social relations, power, institutional surveillance and regulation. The practice of its representations, on the other hand, traditionally enables a culture of shared meaning-making which shapes how an individual perceives, thinks, feels, and acts amidst the production and circulation of discourses. In rethinking the traditional certainties around human body, the space of popular culture fosters a field of inquiry where heterogenous approaches open new apertures in understanding the complexity of human body.</p>
<p>In times marked by advancement in the fields of science, medicine, and technology, the discourses on human body’s representations within popular culture continue to explore what it means to be an embodied human being. The human body is seen to be undergoing experiments to either ‘unlock’ its latent potentiality in terms of modification and amplification, or, to show its vulnerability, messiness, leakiness, and volatility to draw attention to the existential dimension of this embodied being. The pervasiveness of body within cultural spaces pertinently teases out a range of problematics that are also mirrored in virtual and augmented reality, and extend well beyond the corporeal finitude to generate new modalities of becoming. These emerging representations of digitally mediated bodies, virtual bodies, cyborg, etc., within the cultural spaces bring a novel spin to the discursive formations around human body.</p>
<p>In view of the changing contours of body in twenty-first century, <em>LLIDS</em> invites contributions that engage with the various modalities, entanglements, and contestations of human body in conventional spaces such as literature, cinema, painting, sculpture, and exhibitions, as well as new modes of embodiment such as posthuman/transhuman bodies, social/digital media presence, body in correspondence with AI technologies, among others. <em>LLIDS</em> seeks scholarly contributions which address the above theme and/or go beyond them. Some suggestive thematics are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problematics of ideal representations of body</li>
<li>Body in non-western representation</li>
<li>Aesthetics of ‘beautiful’ and ‘ugly’ body</li>
<li>Religion and the regulation of body</li>
<li>Body art vis-à-vis tattooing, scarification, cosmetic surgery, bodybuilding</li>
<li>Body in Performance arts</li>
<li>E-sports and body</li>
<li>Military and the discipline of body</li>
<li>Legal discourse and body</li>
<li>Economics and labour of body</li>
<li>Pre-covid and post-covid human body</li>
<li>Representation of deviant body</li>
<li>Queer bodies in popular culture</li>
<li>Body and caste</li>
<li>Migrant bodies</li>
<li>Representation of disabled bodies</li>
<li>Body, brain, and AI</li>
<li>Metaverse and virtual bodies</li>
</ul>

			<title>[ April 30, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Us and Them: Phenomenological Perspectives in Dialogue</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107049</link>
						<description><p><strong>Call for Abstracts</strong></p>
<p>In classical phenomenology we find reflections on collective intentionality, community, <em>Mitsein</em>, fellow-feeling, interaction, and empathy, which have in turn motivated recent dialogue between phenomenology and the social and cognitive sciences. What has often remained in the background, however, is the question of how to conceive of the relationship between 'Us' and 'Them'. This draws attention to issues of exclusion, marginalisation, national identity, social identities, (non-)belonging, and conflict. In this conference we thus want to explore the various ways in which 'Us' and 'Them' are related, interdependent, and stand in opposition to one another. Our aim is to not only reflect on and better understand the Us/Them dichotomy, but also to put pressure on its assumed dichotomous nature.</p>
<p> Central questions that will be addressed include: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the relation of the "Us" to the "Them"? Is it for example one of conjunction, antagonism, or negation?</li>
<li>What material, normative, affective, or epistemic common ground is taken-for-granted in the assertion of an "Us"?</li>
<li>What are the limitations of distinguishing between inter- and intra-group distinctions? How might phenomenology expand on or show the limits of social scientific research and vice versa?</li>
<li>What role does communication play in mitigating or overcoming the Us/Them dichotomy?</li>
<li>In what ways are different institutions oriented around an implicitly demarcated sense of "Us"? How are similarities and differences rhetorically and discursively exaggerated for political and economic purposes?</li>
</ul>
<p>We particularly encourage papers that bring classical, critical, and applied phenomenological approaches into dialogue with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political philosophy</li>
<li>Critical theory</li>
<li>Feminist philosophy</li>
<li>Social psychology</li>
<li>Social identity theory</li>
<li>Discourse analysis</li>
<li>Political science</li>
<li>Queer theory</li>
<li>Gender studies</li>
<li>Trans* studies and trans* philosophy</li>
<li>Postcolonial and decolonial studies</li>
<li>Sociology</li>
<li>Anthropology</li>
<li>Social ontology</li>
<li>Critical race studies</li>
<li>Migration studies</li>
<li>Affective sciences</li>
<li>Disability studies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>All speakers will be expected to present in-person. Audience participation will be facilitated via Zoom. Speakers will be given 20 minutes to present their paper, along with 10 minutes for Q&amp;A. Papers are expected to address any topic under the heading of 'Us and Them' broadly construed.</p>
<p>We are hoping this event, alongside a conference organized on <em>Critical Phenomenology of the We, </em>will lead to a special issue involving some of the keynote speakers from either conference. Any paper presented at the <em>Us and Them</em> conference will also be encouraged to submit their full papers for consideration.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Submission Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>We invite submissions of titles and abstracts (<strong>300-500 words</strong>) for individual papers. Please prepare abstracts for anonymous review in word or PDF form.</p>
<p>Submissions should be sent to Julia Zaenker <strong>juz@hum.ku.dk</strong>. Please use the following title in the subject line of your email: “Proposal – Us and Them conference". Personal information (author name and affiliation) should be included in the body of the email.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Dates</strong></p>
<p>Latest date to submit titles and abstracts to Julia Zaenker <strong>juz@hum.ku.dk</strong> (300-500 words): <strong>30 April 2023</strong></p>
<p>Notification of reviewers' decision: <strong>31 May 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Date and location</strong></p>
<p>5-6 October 2023, University of Copenhagen, South Campus</p>

Holy texts provide support for both war and peace. In recent decades especially, religion has been viewed as contributing to global strife. The war between Russia and Ukraine has become also a battle between Ukraine’s claim for spiritual independence and Russia’s vision of salvation for ethnic Russians.  In fragile states, such as Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sri Lanka, religious divisions exacerbate strife. Yet, religion has also played a major role in peace-making and conflict resolution.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Our conference will look at the question of religion and conflict. We are cognizant of the gravity of the moment: Religious voices compete in supporting peace and war. Religion is at the heart of political decisions.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>The conference is multidisciplinary and interreligious.

Religion is an essential part of this story. Christian doctrine was the lens through which European explorers, colonizers, and slaveholders understood somatic and cultural difference and, subsequently, the means by which they justified their violent and extractive practices, including the institution of slavery. At the same time, indigenous Americans and Afro-descended people were converting (willingly or otherwise) to Christianity, and, as various scholars have demonstrated, using the principles of spiritual equality and universal Christendom to push back against their subjugation. The existence of black and indigenous confraternities, and the veneration of black saints, likewise offered a means to challenge the associations between racialised identity and reprobation, allowing these groups to lay a claim to full participation in spiritual and social life.  </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>In this one-day conference, we will explore the complex relationship between religion and race from a variety of disciplinary and methodological perspectives. Topics for discussion might include: </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><ul><li><span><span><span><span>Theological approaches to human difference, their expression in art and literature, and their impact in practice</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Racial tropes in devotional art and literature: black saints, black icons, etc</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>The (imagined) relationship between bloodlines and religion </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Confessionalisation and the fashioning of national/racial identities</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>The doctrine of universal Christendom; its affordances and limitations </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Colonial encounters: evangelisation, conversion, and missionary endeavours  </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Religious practices among enslaved people and the African diaspora </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>The histories of indigenous and black confraternities</span></span></span></span></li></ul><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>We hope this will be a truly interdisciplinary event, and welcome papers which explore how these ideas and practices were represented in the art, literature, and material culture of the period. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>We anticipate that papers will be delivered in person and streamed online. <b>Flights and accommodation will be provided for all speakers.</b> Additional support to facilitate access may be provided if required. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>Please send abstracts (200 words), accompanied by a paper title and a brief biographical statement (50-100 words), to </span></span><a href="mailto:mmor@kcl.ac.uk"><span><span>mmor@kcl.ac.uk</span></span></a><span><span>.

			<title>[ April 15, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experiences</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106913</link>
						<description><p><u>Overview</u></p>
<p>The Center for Philosophy of Religion at Rutgers University is pleased to host an in-person, working-papers conference on the Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experience. We are seeking abstracts (150-350 words) from those interested in participating. The tentative date is 15-16 April 2023. And the deadline for submission is 28 February 2023. Participants with accepted submissions will be given hotel accommodations and a modest honorarium to help defray travel costs.</p>
<p><u>Theme</u></p>
<p>The overall theme of the workshop is the Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experiences. Philosophers of religion frequently assign religious experiences important epistemic roles, such as justifying religious beliefs. But religious experiences of the kind philosophers are interested in are also studied in other fields as well, such as psychology and religious studies. However, the psychology and epistemology of religious experiences are presumably not independent; studying them together is likely to be insightful in various ways. To that end, we are interested in bringing together scholars working on the psychology and epistemology of religious experiences. Potential topics include:</p>
<p>·       The nature of religious experiences</p>
<p>·       Taxonomies of religious experiences</p>
<p>·       Potential psychological mechanisms and accounts of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The relation between perception and religious experiences</p>
<p>·       The epistemology of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The interactions between the psychology and epistemology of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The relation of cognitive science of religion to religious experience</p>
<p>Any proposed papers on these topics, or similar ones, are welcome. Papers exploring interdisciplinary approaches are also welcome.</p>
<p><u>Instructions</u></p>
<p> Please submit an abstract (150-350 words), long abstract (350-650 words), or full paper to Timothy Perrine at <a href="mailto:tp654@scarletmail.rutgers.edu">tp654@scarletmail.rutgers.edu</a>. Submission should be prepared for blind review. In a separate document please provide your name, institutional affiliation (if applicable), and contact information. Submission deadline is 28 February; acceptances will be decided by 5 March; and the workshop will be held 15-16 April.</p></description>

As such an element, religion bears and constitutes meanings. According to Brent Nongbri’s <em>Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept</em> (2013), we do not have any scientifically proven knowledge and scholarly consensus regarding the question as to what precisely constitutes a religion. Therefore, the question would be: How do such meanings arise that have shaped the idea of ​​religion and its cultural scope for thousands of years? In the cultural history of religion, we work with images, texts, rituals, music and many other media that transmit an idea of ​religion to humanity. We might be able to understand religion as a system of worldviews that enables us to define beliefs, morals, attitudes, behaviors, practices and, more generally, that relates humanity to transcendental, spiritual and supernatural elements.</p><p>This Special Issue is interested in the transmission of such a system through art, but mainly through literature, focuses its perspective on the representation of Islam in Germanophone literature and culture from the Enlightenment to the present and aims to shape the literary discourses on Islam in the context of following questions:</p><ol><li>How does literature create the encounter between German-speaking and Islamic cultures and what ideas, images and meanings have shaped the literary discourses of Islam from the Enlightenment to the present day?</li><li>What kind of texts or text types prove to be outstanding in the construction of images of Islam in Germanophone literature? What meanings do they produce and how do those meanings affect the idea of the cultural otherness?</li><li>Before the Islamic invasion, the Persian Empire and the Ottoman Empire were self-contained cultural spaces. From an intercultural und interreligious perspective, how does the Germanophone literature describe the influence of Islam on Persian and Ottoman Cultures, and vice versa?</li><li>Since the Enlightenment, what influence exert various images of Islam on the intellectual and controversial debates on Islamic-embossed cultures?</li><li>Discourses on culture conventionally take place in the hermeneutic field of tension of the Own and Foreign. Cultural difference dominates. How are cultural differences constructed on the basis of Islam and what meanings do they produce? What role do similarities play in cultural encounter?</li><li>Travelogues, poetry and novels are genres that tell stories by producing certain images with particular meaning. How are those meanings culturally ingrained and how do they influence the cultural understanding of Islam since the Enlightenment?</li><li>Since the turn of the millennium to 2000s, a series of political occurrences have changed our societies. How does Germanophone literature contend with these social transformations and ?</li></ol><p>Beyond those primary questions, other approaches are also welcome that enrich cultural discourses of Germanophone literature on Islam, especially in the present, constructively and beyond conventional debates. We also strongly invite contributions that deal with art, music, paintings and film.</p><p>Contributors are invited to use research in the field of theories of culture and literature, theories of discourse, narratology, and film studies to explore aspects of the dynamic relationship between culture and religion.</p><p>Prof. Dr. Hamid Tafazoli<br/><em>Guest Editor</em></p><div><b>Prof. Dr. Hamid Tafazoli</b> is a professor at Bielefeld University.</div><p><b>Submission Planning </b></p><p>Deadline for the submission of abstracts: <strong>15 March </strong><b>2023. </b></p><p>Submission of final manuscripts:<b> 15 June 2023. </b></p><p><b>Submission Criteria: </b> </p><ul><li>Abstract and a short biography should be sent to <strong>Hamid Tafazoli</strong> (<span><a href="mailto:hamid.tafazoli@uni-bielefeld.de">hamid.tafazoli@uni-bielefeld.de</a> </span>) and <strong>Sylvia Hao</strong> (<a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a>)</li><li>Final articles, in English only, should be at least 5000 words long; a 150-word abstract and 5 keywords should also be submitted.  </li><li>Authors can include image files (tables, maps, graphs, photographs …) in ..jpg; they should ensure that images are free of rights (or that rights have been obtained).  </li><li>Each article will be peer-reviewed by at least two anonymous referees.</li></ul><p>For further inquiries, please contact: Sylvia Hao for <em>Arts</em>, <strong>Sylvia Hao</strong> (<a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a>) and Editorial Office of <strong><em>Arts</em></strong>（<a href="mailto:arts@mdpi.com">arts@mdpi.com</a>）</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Sylvia Hao in Beijing Now:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a></div></div><p>Editorial Office in Switzerland:</p>

During his travels in Mongolia and China, Karma Pakshi influenced Mӧngke Qan’s social policies and was tortured and imprisoned by Kubilai Qan. In ‘internal exile’ near Xanadu, Karma Pakshi composed several of his philosophical works.</p><p>For online &amp; in-person booking: <a href="https://tickets.ox.ac.uk/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=bodnf&amp;c=jannf" rel="nofollow">https://tickets.ox.ac.uk/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=bodnf&amp;c=jannf</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Charles Manson,</p><p>consultant librarian for Tibetan Studies at the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford University.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:charles.manson@bodleian.ox.ac.uk">charles.manson@bodleian.ox.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://visit.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/event/jan23/the-invention-of-reincarnation" target="_blank">https://visit.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/event/jan23/the-invention-of-reincarnation</a></div></div></div></description>

In previous verses, Paul has shown solidarity across the family of God and other identities (including Creation). However, in taking Paul further, Parker asks how contemporary Jesus followers should move forward in these solidarities today? Can movements that claim to care for Creation ignore the continued "groaning" that Black Lives Matter? Further, how do movements bring about the failure of Empire so that marginalized Black bodies AND Creation experience transformation and move out of "groaning?" For all of this to happen, Empires must fail. How do we bring about that failure?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Organizing team:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h5><span>Venus Bender, American Studies, Frankfurt<br/>Dominik Gautier, Protestant Theology, Oldenburg<br/>Nicole Schneider, American Studies, Eichstätt</span></h5></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Amerikahaus München<br/>Karolinenplatz 3<br/>80333 München</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Info &amp; Registration: </span></span></span><a href="https://webmail.server.uni-frankfurt.de/imp/dynamic.php?page=mailbox" rel="nofollow"><span><span><span><span>nicole.schneider@ku.de</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:nicole.schneider@ku.de">nicole.schneider@ku.de</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://bridgingblackfreedomstruggles.com/" target="_blank">https://bridgingblackfreedomstruggles.com</a></div></div></div></description>

<p align="center"><strong>Religion in Motion: Between Borders and Belonging</strong></p>
<p align="center">The biennial conference of the Nederlands Genootschap voor Godsdienstwetenschappen (NGG) - the Dutch Association for the Study of Religion</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Nijmegen, the Netherlands, November 1-3 2023</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keynote Speakers include Dr. Nadia Fadil (KU Leuven), Dr. Basit Iqbal (McMaster University), Dr. Carly Crouch (Radboud University) and Dr. Birgit Meyer (Utrecht University).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Religiosity and mobility have been topics of research and debate for scholars working with different theoretical, methodological, and disciplinary approaches. In this conference, we explore how the study of religion might be transformed through a focus on mobility in its various forms.</p>
<p>We ask, for instance: How is mobility an integral part of religious traditions? How does religion inform experiences of belonging in migratory contexts? How do political, geographical, cultural, and religious borders shape people’s lives? Their visions of the past and the future? Their experiences of home and belonging? Their aspirations and imaginations of destiny?</p>
<p>We examine how state and/or religious authorities classify migrants and consider the ends towards which such categorization works. We ask how different kinds of borders influence the lives and faiths of people on the move, and consider how these modern forms of mobility have historical roots across a range of sociopolitical and geographical milieus.</p>
<p>Bringing together scholars who work at the intersection of mobility and religion, this conference invites scholars of religion to converse with those working in anthropology and sociology; history, law, and political science; and the study of transnationalism, borders, migration, and refugees, to name just a few fields.</p>
<p>This conference therefore aims to broaden the theoretical and methodological repertoires for future studies of religion in motion whereby mobility and religion are analyzed not as separate themes, but as critical axes of people’s religious experiences across traditions, times, and spaces, with mobility and religion acting as co-constitutive of beliefs, practices and socialities.</p>
<p>We encourage graduate students, early career scholars, and established academics to use this meeting as an opportunity to think through research agendas, challenges, and inspirations for current and future research, particularly those that decenter Europe, or rather, locate Europe as only one yet powerful bulwark, goal, and trajectory in a global world. We also welcome contributions which explore less commonly explored religious and spiritual traditions, alongside those better studied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Topics which might be explored can include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>●      Transformations in refugee religiosity</p>
<p>●      Terror, death and dying en route or in migratory settings</p>
<p>●      (Social) life, resilience, humor and joy en route or in migratory settings</p>
<p>●      Religious lives of migrants</p>
<p>●      The role of religion in forced migration</p>
<p>●      Technologies of migration and religiosity</p>
<p>●      State governance of movement and religion</p>
<p>●      Religion, migration, and law</p>
<p>●      Religion in transit</p>
<p>●      Transnational networks of religious institutions</p>
<p>●      Migration, religion, and racialization</p>
<p>●      The role of religion in enforcing, transcending, or overturning borders</p>
<p>●      The role of borders, boundaries, and crossings in religion</p>
<p>●      Syncretism, hybridity or polyculturalism? Theories on the creation of new religions</p>
<p>●      (The implications of) definitions, including “refugee” and “migrant”</p>
<p>●      Pilgrimage</p>
<p>●      Missionary activities</p>
<p>●      Mobile relics and material religion</p>
<p>●      Theology of migration, with special attention for intercultural dialogue and transnationalism</p>
<p>●      Migration and holy scriptures</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We welcome submissions for individual papers or preorganized panels (including innovative formats like author-meets-critics, roundtables, film screenings with discussion, etc.).</p>
<p>Individual paper proposals should include: 1) a title of the presentation 2) the name and institutional affiliation of the author 3) a 300 word abstract.</p>
<p>Panel proposals should include all the above for each paper included along with: 1) the name and institutional affiliation of the organizer 2) a 300 word abstract for the panel itself.</p>
<p>Panels and papers will be considered for inclusion in a special conference issue for the Dutch journal in the study of religion, <em>NTT Journal for the Study of Religion</em>.</p>

With a thematic focus for each issue, the journal is published online in English and Marathi. We are happy to announce the eighteenth call for submissions around the theme, <strong>मिथक /Myth</strong>.</p>
<p>For a story to be a myth, it must have travelled through time. It must have changed multiple hands on its meandering journey, with each hand shaping it in some way big or small. As this form of story travels from one point to another, it morphs into myriad ways. While the specificities of a myth that ground it in a certain socio-political or historical context may change, the ideas that form its core persist through time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can tell a lot about a society from the mythology that it generates. These myths may serve as carriers of society’s dominant value system; they may reveal the things people feared, and the things they revered. A myth about a person can make them seem larger than life, or decimate their reputation; a myth about a place can draw people to it from far and wide, or it can drive people away. Present in all media, including oral, print, and electronic, myths have a way of affecting our psyche in deeply personal ways. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At times, a myth is associated with falsification, a morphing of truth to support devious intentions. It is at odds with hard, empirical fact–data that seeks to reduce the world to pure information. While myth speaks to feelings, data speaks to rationale. While myth is characterised by fluidity, data remains unchanged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do myths mean to you? How do you visualise a myth in your own creative work? How does the free circulation of myth — breaking the bounds of time and space — affect individuals and society? How do societies, individuals or state-systems at the centre of power create or rediscover a myth and provide their own meaning to it?

It may transform the religious cultures, rituals, and traditions because of the human mobility and the host country’s reaction. Related to it, new formations of transnational interaction and organization emerg, and their effects may not be limited with their own group but may extend to uncertain areas.  It becomes clear that religious issues are interrelated with many social, cultural, and political matters such as integration, identity, diaspora, social and religious movements, and the religious pluralism of the immigrant’s groups.</p><p>The aim of the sessions in this track is for papers to explore empirical analysis of the discourses and practices of transnational religious groups and the link between religion and migration with political, historical, cultural, and social transitions. We offer an open call for any other topics dealing with religion and migration, especially proposals that address theoretical and methodical issues in the field of migration in relation to religious studies. At the intersections between religious studies, migration studies and research on religious groups, the topics may include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Migration and Religion in Theoretical Approaches</li><li>Migration and Religious Ritual Changes</li><li>Transnational Religious Groups</li><li>Religious Minorities and Migration</li><li>New Religious Movements</li><li>Religious Organizations</li><li>Religious Conflicts and Religious Radicalization</li><li>Religious Diversity</li><li>Religion, Migration and Pluralism</li></ul><p>Structured abstracts (up to 500 words) are invited for submission.

			<title>[Today] Talk or similar: The Lost World of Genesis One</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/108217</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>John Walton<br/><br/><p>Dear Colleague,<br/><br/>You are invited to participate in the next session of the Logic and Religion Webinar Series which will be held on <strong>February 23, 2023</strong>, at <strong>4pm CET</strong> with the topic:</p>
<p><strong>THE LOST WORLD OF GENESIS ONE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker: </strong>John Walton (Wheaton College, USA). <br/><strong>Chair: </strong>Francisco de Assis Mariano (University of Missouri-Columbia, USA).</p>
<p>Please, register in advance to receive the zoom link:</p>
<p>https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars</p>
<p> <br/>Abstract: Genesis One is indisputably one of the most fundamental passages of the Bible, and also one of the most controversial. It is often viewed as being in conflict with modern science. In the Lost World of Genesis One a case is made that when we read Genesis One as an ancient text the alleged conflict will disappear and greater understanding of the teaching of the text can be gained.</p>
<p>Join us 5 minutes prior to the beginning of the session!<br/> <br/>With best wishes,</p>
<p>-- </p>

						<description>Publication Name: Phenomenology and the Sciences: Between Foundation, Clarification, and Material Contributions. Studia Phaenomenologica XXIV (2024)<br/><br/><p>What can phenomenology say nowadays concerning the sciences? Is phenomenology able to provide the ground stone Husserl dreamt of, or, as he himself says in the <em>Crisis</em>, “der Traum ist ausgeträumt”? If this is the case, what is the position that phenomenology can assume towards sciences? Can phenomenology itself be considered as a specific science? Can phenomenology offer any contribution to scientific research, both basic and applied? Should phenomenology be understood as a kind of epistemology? Or is there a specific field of research that pertains specifically to phenomenology and that is not on a pair with epistemological reflection?</p>
<p>From its very beginning, phenomenology has shown a strong connection with scientific thought and the sciences. Husserl’s (more or less orthodox) followers, and, more generally, scientist and philosophers, who have found some kind of inspiration in Husserl’s phenomenological project, have variously tried to implement the idea, according to which phenomenology should prepare the ground, clarify the basic concepts and practices, as well as the relationships between different scientific disciplines. Just to mention some, think of Alfred Schutz for sociology, Hermann Weyl for Physics, Oskar Becker for mathematics and geometry, Ludwig Binswanger and Erwin Straus for psychopathology, Roman Jakobson for linguistics, Aron Gurwitsch for psychology. During the past decades, phenomenological researches have especially been carried out in collaboration with, or within the field, of cognitive sciences, the psy-sciences, and the neurosciences. The foundational task of phenomenology has only seldom been at the center of these researches, though. More recently, phenomenology has been seen as offering important insights and contributions to questions and investigations pertaining physics, as well as a potentially powerful tool to tackle classical epistemological questions, and questions concerning philosophy of science, thus finally opening a new bridge between phenomenology and analytic philosophy beyond the restricted field of philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>All in all, phenomenology is nowadays active in two ways towards the sciences, somehow confirming its hybrid position: on the one hand, phenomenology has a clarificatory task, that is concurrently foundational one; on the other hand, phenomenology is practiced in order to offer insights and, more generally, contributions that allow enlarging knowledge within specific sciences.</p>
<p>The 2024 issue of <em>Studia Phaenomenologica</em> will be devoted to the aforementioned and related questions. We invite scholars to submit contributions that tackle the following issues, and strictly related ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>phenomenological clarification of the concept of science and non-science</li>
<li>phenomenological foundations of specific scientific disciplines</li>
<li>phenomenological contributions to scientific knowledge</li>
<li>phenomenology and epistemology</li>
<li>cases of knowledge transfer between phenomenology and specific scientific disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>DEADLINE: 1st of June 2023</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines: https://zetabooks.com/library/journals/studia-phaenomenologica/</p>
<p>The papers should be sent to: submissions@phenomenology.ro (subject title: <em>Studia Phaenomenologica </em>2024)</p></description>

			<title>[ September 21, 2023 -  September 23, 2023] Conference or similar: Phenomenology and the Limits of Experience</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/108173</link>
						<description>Venue: Șoseaua Panduri nr. 90<br/><br/><p>The recent publication of Husserliana XLII, <em>Die Grenzprobleme der Phänomenologie</em>, in 2014 has revitalized a concern with the question of the “limits of experience,” a question that phenomenology has been struggling with throughout its history. In discussing such phenomena as death, birth, deep sleep, or dream, Husserl elaborates a vast set of expressions intended to integrate them systematically into his phenomenology as “marginal problems” (<em>Randprobleme</em>), “higher altitude problems” (<em>Höhenprobleme</em>), “transition problems” (<em>Übergangsprobleme</em>). In contrast to Husserl, it was already Eugen Fink who clearly saw that such issues actually exceed the capacities of classical phenomenology and call for methodological innovations. His plea for a “constructive” and “speculative” turn in phenomenology originates in such considerations. Similarly, existentialist and hermeneutic philosophers working within a phenomenological tradition, such as Jaspers or Heidegger, recognized that aside from posing methodological difficulties for phenomenology, phenomena in which being is confronted with the “possibility of its impossibility” (death, anxiety) can themselves serve as a springboard for more general and penetrating insights. More recent phenomenological projects, following and going beyond Husserl’s essential characterization of alienness as “accessibility in genuine inaccessibility,” shed new light on the experiential (co-)constitution of limits in the homeworld/alienworld dynamic and place it at the center of their non-foundationalist endeavors.</p>
<p>The present conference aims to address multifarious implications of the “limits of experience” in phenomenology. We are interested in contributions that <em>thematically</em> explore and expand the spectrum of limit-phenomena by tackling the limits of perception, recollection, experience of the other (empathy), bodily expressivity, sense-making, etc. We also welcome contributions that reflect <em>systematically</em> on the limits and borders of phenomenology as a discipline and on its relations to other philosophical or scientific fields and traditions. Submissions that <em>methodologically</em> engage with the potentialities of limits, posing questions of phenomenological access to such phenomena or addressing the relevance of anomalies and extreme cases for a phenomenological eidetics, are encouraged as well.</p>
<p>We welcome contributions dealing with (but not limited to) any of the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limits of various modalities of experience (limits of perception, limits of phantasy, limits of memory, limits of image-consciousness)</li>
<li>Limits of representation (the unimaginable, revelation, saturated phenomena)</li>
<li>Limits of understanding (nonsense, absurdity)</li>
<li>Limits of vulnerability (violence, pain)</li>
<li>Limits of empathy (cruelty, torture, abuse)</li>
<li>Limits of intersubjectivity (adversity, confrontation, alien/foreigner/stranger)</li>
<li>Limits of sociality (radical solitude)</li>
<li>Limits of discourse (incommunicability in speech and gesture)</li>
<li>Limits of experience in the human-animal relation</li>
<li>Limits of phenomenology and interdisciplinarity</li>
<li>Limits in phenomenological method(s) and phenomenological practice (the incompleteness of reductions, the limits of a priori research)</li>
<li>Methodological uses for limit-phenomena</li>
<li>Phenomenological architectonics and the systematic position of limit-problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Language: The conference will be held in English.</p>
<p>Venue: University of Bucharest (Rectorate Building, Șoseaua Panduri nr. 1).</p>
<p>Deadline for submissions: April 10, 2023.</p>

The role of women in cultic settings is, as a rule, secondary, as is also the authority of female ministers of religion, while the social benefits of those appointed with religious duties are also incomparable with the privileges received by men.  This year, we invite proposals that explore the female share in leadership roles related to religion (saints, prophetesses, priestesses, nuns, preachers, witches, shamans and more), and emphasize how their achievements are reflected in history and art. How prominent female figures have compromised men’s secured positions of power in socioreligious structures? What was their role in shaping gender-responsive societies? We encourage also papers that examine through gender lens the impact of religion on civic life by analysing the deeds of women of faith from a political perspective, or deal with cases of political power over religion, in cases of women who achieved to change traditional religious concepts, practices, customs or symbols. We welcome papers that deal with all religious systems from ancient to present times. </p>

We are particularly interested in proposals which investigate the belief that, in one guise or another, language is “a gift from the Gods to men”. What does this mean? Why was such a conceit taken seriously? What counted as “the Sacred”? What hermeneutic and semiotic ingenuity was utilised to interpret what it betokened and in forging these interpretations into signs, significance and language? </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The interest of seeking answers to these questions isn’t limited to everything that is fascinating about these enigmas all unto themselves. It also creates an opportunity to gain as yet unsuspected insights into the meaning-affording potential of words and language. More than that, it offers us a framework and a perspective from which to identify and typify the limits and shortcoming of currently dominant ideas pertaining to the nature, vocation, applications and “apophantic” powers of language.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><b><span><span><span><span>Conference theme and objectives</span></span></span></span></b></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Ancient Egypt, Vedic India, China of the Shang dynasty, the Hellenes at the time of Homer, the Celts, the Aztecs and cultures the world over all believed that the language they spoke was masterminded and forged for them by some higher-than-mortal agency. Just how starkly this contrasts with “language science” in our religiously post‑religious modern age needs no explanation. For us it is simply absurd to maintain that language is anything but a tool devised by <i>homo symbolicus</i> to be able to interact purposively and productively with others of his kind. And yet this view is problematic. </span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>First because the “roots” of all the languages we use to discredit ancient lores about “glottogony” are themselves the products of precisely the kind of mythologies we wish to exorcise from any discussion about language. Second, the assumption that there is something “backward” or “superstitious” about these “exotic” examples of speculation pertaining to the origin of language is now, quite understandably, considered to be the scholarly corollary of a “colonialist” attitude towards “<i>la mentalité primitive</i>”. Third, many authoritative voices in cutting edge, game-changing thought in literary theory and semiotics regularly appeal to “supra‑rational” agencies and actants to supply their theorisation with what cannot be supplied by being “rational” about where language comes from, the nature of its signifying powers, and quite simply what it is. Finally, by thoughtlessly assuming that such myths are merely figments of an “unenlightened” mentality, we overlook the possibility that these “irrational” theories may rest upon rationales that a patient analysis of why they were adhered to would demonstrate to be credible in terms of the very criteria used to postulate their worthlessness. </span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Perplexed by all this, the organisers of the 2023 colloquium are looking for contributions from colleagues who can elucidate for their peers why so many communities believed that it made perfect sense to maintain that their speech was a “gift of the Gods to mortals”. </span><span>Why was such a conceit taken seriously? </span><span>What “d</span><span>ivinatory techniques” were involved in apprehending what counted as the Sacred? What hermeneutic and semiotic ingenuity was utilised to interpret what it betokened and in forging these interpretations into signs, significance and language? </span><span>What rationale is at work in the assumption one encounters so often that, in some sense or another, the Divine itself is a living, breathing, </span><i><span><span>pulsatingly resonant</span></span></i><span><span> property of </span></span><span>language and that its constituent words encode, mediate and reveal something “sublime” about their <i>denotata</i>? </span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>The point of raising these questions is not to celebrate or rehabilitate ‘traditional’ belief systems. Nor is it to be a recrimination of views on the nature, vocation and finality of words and language which repudiate the idea that anything mystical or supernatural should be involved in the analysis. What we really want is to enrich and vary the habitual acceptations and applications of linguistics, semiotics and the philosophy of language by exploring what could be significant or worthwhile about theories maintaining that language is an emanationist bye‑product of other-than-mortal agencies, for instance of <i>Gaia</i> or of one of her counterparts.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Obviously, the views of Indologists, Orientalists, Arabists and Indigenous Studies specialists on these points would be greatly appreciated. Idem for colleagues hailing from Ethnolinguistics, Ecosemiotics, Literary Theory, Comparative Poetics, Philology and sundry kindred fields.<br/>But that isn’t all. We also want to learn more about the way obsolete doxas about the divine origins of speech can be repurposed and undergo a rebirth in forms and in places one would least expect to find them. This would be particularly the case as concerns the theories of ostensibly ‘atheist’ <i>avant-garde</i> thinkers like Blanchot, Foucault, Derrida and Lacan as well as of pioneering artists like Hölderlin, Mallarmé, Baudelaire, Artaud, Ponge, Joyce, Eliot, etc.</span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><b><span><span><span>Suggested Topics</span></span></span></b></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We invite papers on topics that may include (but are not limited to):</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><ol><li><span><span><span><span>Original research of a critical, comparativist or historical nature on Glottogonic theories, mythologies, folklores, traditions, </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Studies which illuminate (<b><span>a</span></b>) the divinatory techniques involved in apprehending what counted as the Sacred, (<b><span>b</span></b>) the forms in which its effulgence manifested itself (<b><span>c</span></b>) the hermeneutic ingenuity utilised in interpreting what it was believed to mean and (<b><span>d</span></b>) the semiotic engineering mobilised to forge this meaning into signs, significance and language,</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Critical assessments of the semiotic rationales that are operative in the conceit that language can encode, mediate and be “oversignified” by a higher order, “hieratic” content, significance or meaning, </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Contributions from specialists in Ecosemiotics and Ethnolinguistics which elucidate how “animist” cultures assumed that the natural environment had a voice and a language and how the meaning it communicated was translated into human speech,</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Reflexions on the way that the properties of signs that are presumed to be “hieroglossic” differ from those that are deemed to be “demotic” or “profane”,</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Papers on “the Language of the Gods” <i>vs</i>. “the Language of Mortals”</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Insights into the dynamics of the dialogue which ensues when heterogeneous conceptions of the “Sacred” origin and character of speech encounter one another,</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Analyses of what happens to an established model of Sacred speech when it faces challenges to its authority in the name of “reason” or “science” or when facing pressure from societal, cultural, cultural or political changes, </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The challenges and/or opportunities posed to literary artists when they are required to recognise, respect and celebrate the presumed Sacred character of their language while using it creatively, </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The “deterritorialisation” of tradition-hallowed ideas on the Sacred origins and character of language and its “reterritorialisation” in the thought of contemporary literary theorists and in the works of avant-gardist literary artists. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ol><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This list is only indicative.

<p> </p>
<p>Statistics show the decline of religion in the western world but religion and its institutions maintain a prominent place in society and in creative outputs. Popular culture interprets, challenges and recreates religious practice and identity. At a time fewer people may be engaging with actual religious organisations or institutions, popular culture is more powerful than ever in shaping perceptions. Sexuality, agency, authority and leadership all register when popular culture turns attention to sisters in religious orders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nuns enable a rich array of story-telling types and genres, and character archetypes and stereotypes in both film and television. Nuns are central characters in some of the most popular and notable film and television productions of all time, among them <em>The Sound of Music, Black Narcissus, The Bells of St Mary</em>, and <em>Philomena </em>on the big screen and <em>Call the Midwife</em> and <em>Brides of Christ</em> on television. Alongside these major dramas lurk the disreputable works in the so-called ‘lost continent’ of exploitation and horror, from <em>Silent Night, Deadly Night</em> and <em>American Horror Story </em>to the many films in the ‘nunsploitation’ grindhouse films.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite their prevalence in popular culture and the strongly consistent visual aesthetic of cinematic and televisual nuns because of the (often anachronistically retained) habit, the presence and meaning of religious sisters in popular culture has been little interrogated in academic literature.  Rebecca Sullivan’s <em>Visual Habits: Nuns, Feminism and American Postwar Popular culture</em> from 2005 is an important survey but is limited to the United States. Colleen McDannell’s <em>Material Christianity: Religion and Popular Culture in America </em>(1995) is now nearly 30 years old and takes a far wider focus than women religious. This collection therefore will be a timely and exciting opportunity to explore this multitude of works.</p>
<p>While the type and number of popular culture works about nuns is expansive and growing, especially in the years since earlier works on religion in popular culture were written, the specific focus of this collection will be for chapters exploring the appropriation of the imagery and activity of nuns by popular culture in ways that have often, but not universally, created on-screen nuns as a strange, disturbing or even abusive presence. Central to this collection will be exploration of the tensions between actual and fictional nuns and the potential found in genres from drama to comedy and others to raise questions about the identity, actions, reputations and agency of women in religious orders. In actuality, in the western world at least, the number of women pursuing a vocation as a religious is terminally declining. The nuns who remain are often a visually inconspicuous presence as post-Vatican II and other modernising trends mean religious habits are either reduced or wholly abandoned. Alongside and contrary to this real-world decline and visual eclipse, fully habited remain a major element of popular culture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nuns and other religious do retain some prominence but because of the number of official commissions and investigations into historic abuse in convent run orphanages, missions, schools, and laundries and from Ireland to Canada to Australia, stories of actual abuse have emerged worse than any possible cinematic horror. Similarly, non-fictional and documentary film making, have opened up tensions in perceptions of nuns from the laudatory presentation of Sister Helen Prejean in first documentary then film about the abolition of the death penalty to the competing portrayals of Mother Teresa in terms of both her public and private personae.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From these points about the actual and the fictional, there extends exploration of the inherent strangeness of nuns, their vocations and their enclosed lives that frequently registers in popular culture. In short, the institutions western religious orders, the numbers, their viability and their reputations are pursuing complex and challenging trajectories in the modern world. Analogous to these actual issues of identity and practice are the expansive, prominent, and still growing works on nuns in popular culture. In this popular culture, nuns have been many things from the wise and caring presence of Hollywood classics such as <em>The Sound of Music</em>, the sinister and even satanic of horror movies, then sources of female agency, leadership and identity that may be an affront to or challenged by masculine authority such as in <em>Doubt </em>to <em>Two Mules for Sister Sara </em>and <em>Lambs of God</em>, to agents of abuse and neglect seen in <em>The Magdalene Sisters </em>and <em>Philomena</em>. Perhaps most often they are simply a strange and even challenging presence, a stranger to wider society, but still essential to popular culture. It is also important to note that religion is not declining in the global south, and popular culture there may be presenting its own impressions of female religious life.</p>

<p>The organisers of the <em>HHH-</em>2023 conference invite paper proposals from their colleagues in the Human Sciences who can elucidate the hermeneutical and semiotic principles which were operative in the ideas that peoples in earlier times and in non-Western cultures entertained about the languages they spoke. We are particularly interested in proposals which investigate the belief that, in one guise or another, language is “a gift from the Gods to men”. What does this mean? Why was such a conceit taken seriously? What counted as “the Sacred”? What hermeneutic and semiotic ingenuity was utilised to interpret what it betokened and in forging these interpretations into signs, significance and language? The interest of seeking answers to these questions isn’t limited to everything that is fascinating about these enigmas all unto themselves. It also creates an opportunity to gain as yet unsuspected insights into the meaning-affording potential of words and language. More than that, it offers us a framework and a perspective from which to identify and typify the limits and shortcoming of currently dominant ideas pertaining to the nature, vocation, applications and “apophantic” powers of language.</p>
<p><strong>Conference theme and objectives </strong></p>
<p>Ancient Egypt, Vedic India, China of the Shang dynasty, the Hellenes at the time of Homer, the Celts, the Aztecs and cultures the world over all believed that the language they spoke was masterminded and forged for them by some higher-than-mortal agency. Just how starkly this contrasts with “language science” in our religiously post‑religious modern age needs no explanation. For us it is simply absurd to maintain that language is anything but a tool devised by <em>homo symbolicus</em> to be able to interact purposively and productively with others of his kind. And yet this view is problematic.</p>
<p>First because the “roots” of all the languages we use to discredit ancient lores about “glottogony” are themselves the products of precisely the kind of mythologies we wish to exorcise from any discussion about language. Second, the assumption that there is something “backward” or “superstitious” about these “exotic” examples of speculation pertaining to the origin of language is now, quite understandably, considered to be the scholarly corollary of a “colonialist” attitude towards “<em>la mentalité primitive</em>”. Third, many authoritative voices in cutting edge, game-changing thought in literary theory and semiotics regularly appeal to “supra‑rational” agencies and actants to supply their theorisation with what cannot be supplied by being “rational” about where language comes from, the nature of its signifying powers, and quite simply what it is. Finally, by thoughtlessly assuming that such myths are merely figments of an “unenlightened” mentality, we overlook the possibility that these “irrational” theories may rest upon rationales that a patient analysis of why they were adhered to would demonstrate to be credible in terms of the very criteria used to postulate their worthlessness.</p>
<p>Perplexed by all this, the organisers of the 2023 colloquium are looking for contributions from colleagues who can elucidate for their peers why so many communities believed that it made perfect sense to maintain that their speech was a “gift of the Gods to mortals”. Why was such a conceit taken seriously? What “divinatory techniques” were involved in apprehending what counted as the Sacred? What hermeneutic and semiotic ingenuity was utilised to interpret what it betokened and in forging these interpretations into signs, significance and language? What rationale is at work in the assumption one encounters so often that, in some sense or another, the Divine itself is a living, breathing, <em>pulsatingly resonant</em> property of language and that its constituent words encode, mediate and reveal something “sublime” about their <em>denotata</em>?</p>
<p>The point of raising these questions is not to celebrate or rehabilitate ‘traditional’ belief systems. Nor is it to be a recrimination of views on the nature, vocation and finality of words and language which repudiate the idea that anything mystical or supernatural should be involved in the analysis. What we really want is to enrich and vary the habitual acceptations and applications of linguistics, semiotics and the philosophy of language by exploring what could be significant or worthwhile about theories maintaining that language is an emanationist bye‑product of other-than-mortal agencies, for instance of <em>Gaia</em> or of one of her counterparts.</p>
<p>Obviously, the views of Indologists, Orientalists, Arabists and Indigenous Studies specialists on these points would be greatly appreciated. Idem for colleagues hailing from Ethnolinguistics, Ecosemiotics, Literary Theory, Comparative Poetics, Philology and sundry kindred fields. <br/> But that isn’t all. We also want to learn more about the way obsolete doxas about the divine origins of speech can be repurposed and undergo a rebirth in forms and in places one would least expect to find them. This would be particularly the case as concerns the theories of ostensibly ‘atheist’ <em>avant-garde</em> thinkers like Blanchot, Foucault, Derrida and Lacan as well as of pioneering artists like Hölderlin, Mallarmé, Baudelaire, Artaud, Ponge, Joyce, Eliot, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested Topics</strong></p>
<p>We invite papers on topics that may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>- Original research of a critical, comparativist or historical nature on Glottogonic theories, mythologies, folklores, traditions,</p>
<p>- Studies which illuminate (<strong>a</strong>) the divinatory techniques involved in apprehending what counted as the Sacred, (<strong>b</strong>) the forms in which its effulgence manifested itself (<strong>c</strong>) the hermeneutic ingenuity utilised in interpreting what it was believed to mean and (<strong>d</strong>) the semiotic engineering mobilised to forge this meaning into signs, significance and language,</p>
<p>- Critical assessments of the semiotic rationales that are operative in the conceit that language can encode, mediate and be “oversignified” by a higher order, “hieratic” content, significance or meaning,</p>
<p>- Contributions from specialists in Ecosemiotics and Ethnolinguistics which elucidate how “animist” cultures assumed that the natural environment had a voice and a language and how the meaning it communicated was translated into human speech,</p>
<p>- Reflexions on the way that the properties of signs that are presumed to be “hieroglossic” differ from those that are deemed to be “demotic” or “profane”,</p>
<p>- Papers on “the Language of the Gods” <em>vs</em>. “the Language of Mortals”</p>
<p>- Insights into the dynamics of the dialogue which ensues when heterogeneous conceptions of the “Sacred” origin and character of speech encounter one another,</p>
<p>- Analyses of what happens to an established model of Sacred speech when it faces challenges to its authority in the name of “reason” or “science” or when facing pressure from societal, cultural, cultural or political changes,</p>
<p>- The challenges and/or opportunities posed to literary artists when they are required to recognise, respect and celebrate the presumed Sacred character of their language while using it creatively,</p>
<p>- The “deterritorialisation” of tradition-hallowed ideas on the Sacred origins and character of language and its “reterritorialisation” in the thought of contemporary literary theorists and in the works of avant-gardist literary artists.</p>
<p>This list is only indicative. Anyone can approach the topic as they wish, provided that the subject matter dealt with, and the conclusions drawn from the analyses carried out provide fresh, evidence-based insights that are recognisably relevant to the conference theme.</p>

For example, sabbatical and jubilee traditions structure restorative rest for bodies and land. Additionally, traditional ecological, embodied, and place-based knowledge systems shape dynamic interactions between people, food, and lands.  Such knowledge systems may be responsive to disruptions to local land, waterway, and climate. American Academy of Religion/Society of Biblical Literature takes place in San Antonio, Texas, November 18-21, 2023. Paper and panel proposals for this co-sponsored session should be sent by email to Dr. Roberta Sabbath, <a href="mailto:roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu" target="_blank">roberta.sabbath@unlv.edu</a>, rather than using PAPERS.</p>

Religion is an essential part of this story. Christian doctrine was the lens through which European explorers, colonizers, and slaveholders understood somatic and cultural difference and, subsequently, the means by which they justified their violent and extractive practices, including the institution of slavery. At the same time, indigenous Americans and Afro-descended people were converting (willingly or otherwise) to Christianity, and, as various scholars have demonstrated, using the principles of spiritual equality and universal Christendom to push back against their subjugation. The existence of black and indigenous confraternities, and the veneration of black saints, likewise offered a means to challenge the associations between racialised identity and reprobation, allowing these groups to lay a claim to full participation in spiritual and social life.  </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>In this one-day conference, we will explore the complex relationship between religion and race from a variety of disciplinary and methodological perspectives. Topics for discussion might include: </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><ul><li><span><span><span><span>Theological approaches to human difference, their expression in art and literature, and their impact in practice</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Racial tropes in devotional art and literature: black saints, black icons, etc</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>The (imagined) relationship between bloodlines and religion </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Confessionalisation and the fashioning of national/racial identities</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>The doctrine of universal Christendom; its affordances and limitations </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Colonial encounters: evangelisation, conversion, and missionary endeavours  </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Religious practices among enslaved people and the African diaspora </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>The histories of indigenous and black confraternities</span></span></span></span></li></ul><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>We hope this will be a truly interdisciplinary event, and welcome papers which explore how these ideas and practices were represented in the art, literature, and material culture of the period. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>We anticipate that papers will be delivered in person and streamed online. <b>Flights and accommodation will be provided for all speakers.</b> Additional support to facilitate access may be provided if required. </span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span>Please send abstracts (200 words), accompanied by a paper title and a brief biographical statement (50-100 words), to </span></span><a href="mailto:mmor@kcl.ac.uk"><span><span>mmor@kcl.ac.uk</span></span></a><span><span>.

			<title>[ April 15, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experiences</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106913</link>
						<description><p><u>Overview</u></p>
<p>The Center for Philosophy of Religion at Rutgers University is pleased to host an in-person, working-papers conference on the Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experience. We are seeking abstracts (150-350 words) from those interested in participating. The tentative date is 15-16 April 2023. And the deadline for submission is 28 February 2023. Participants with accepted submissions will be given hotel accommodations and a modest honorarium to help defray travel costs.</p>
<p><u>Theme</u></p>
<p>The overall theme of the workshop is the Psychology and Epistemology of Religious Experiences. Philosophers of religion frequently assign religious experiences important epistemic roles, such as justifying religious beliefs. But religious experiences of the kind philosophers are interested in are also studied in other fields as well, such as psychology and religious studies. However, the psychology and epistemology of religious experiences are presumably not independent; studying them together is likely to be insightful in various ways. To that end, we are interested in bringing together scholars working on the psychology and epistemology of religious experiences. Potential topics include:</p>
<p>·       The nature of religious experiences</p>
<p>·       Taxonomies of religious experiences</p>
<p>·       Potential psychological mechanisms and accounts of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The relation between perception and religious experiences</p>
<p>·       The epistemology of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The interactions between the psychology and epistemology of religious experience</p>
<p>·       The relation of cognitive science of religion to religious experience</p>
<p>Any proposed papers on these topics, or similar ones, are welcome. Papers exploring interdisciplinary approaches are also welcome.</p>
<p><u>Instructions</u></p>
<p> Please submit an abstract (150-350 words), long abstract (350-650 words), or full paper to Timothy Perrine at <a href="mailto:tp654@scarletmail.rutgers.edu">tp654@scarletmail.rutgers.edu</a>. Submission should be prepared for blind review. In a separate document please provide your name, institutional affiliation (if applicable), and contact information. Submission deadline is 28 February; acceptances will be decided by 5 March; and the workshop will be held 15-16 April.</p></description>

As such an element, religion bears and constitutes meanings. According to Brent Nongbri’s <em>Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept</em> (2013), we do not have any scientifically proven knowledge and scholarly consensus regarding the question as to what precisely constitutes a religion. Therefore, the question would be: How do such meanings arise that have shaped the idea of ​​religion and its cultural scope for thousands of years? In the cultural history of religion, we work with images, texts, rituals, music and many other media that transmit an idea of ​religion to humanity. We might be able to understand religion as a system of worldviews that enables us to define beliefs, morals, attitudes, behaviors, practices and, more generally, that relates humanity to transcendental, spiritual and supernatural elements.</p><p>This Special Issue is interested in the transmission of such a system through art, but mainly through literature, focuses its perspective on the representation of Islam in Germanophone literature and culture from the Enlightenment to the present and aims to shape the literary discourses on Islam in the context of following questions:</p><ol><li>How does literature create the encounter between German-speaking and Islamic cultures and what ideas, images and meanings have shaped the literary discourses of Islam from the Enlightenment to the present day?</li><li>What kind of texts or text types prove to be outstanding in the construction of images of Islam in Germanophone literature? What meanings do they produce and how do those meanings affect the idea of the cultural otherness?</li><li>Before the Islamic invasion, the Persian Empire and the Ottoman Empire were self-contained cultural spaces. From an intercultural und interreligious perspective, how does the Germanophone literature describe the influence of Islam on Persian and Ottoman Cultures, and vice versa?</li><li>Since the Enlightenment, what influence exert various images of Islam on the intellectual and controversial debates on Islamic-embossed cultures?</li><li>Discourses on culture conventionally take place in the hermeneutic field of tension of the Own and Foreign. Cultural difference dominates. How are cultural differences constructed on the basis of Islam and what meanings do they produce? What role do similarities play in cultural encounter?</li><li>Travelogues, poetry and novels are genres that tell stories by producing certain images with particular meaning. How are those meanings culturally ingrained and how do they influence the cultural understanding of Islam since the Enlightenment?</li><li>Since the turn of the millennium to 2000s, a series of political occurrences have changed our societies. How does Germanophone literature contend with these social transformations and ?</li></ol><p>Beyond those primary questions, other approaches are also welcome that enrich cultural discourses of Germanophone literature on Islam, especially in the present, constructively and beyond conventional debates. We also strongly invite contributions that deal with art, music, paintings and film.</p><p>Contributors are invited to use research in the field of theories of culture and literature, theories of discourse, narratology, and film studies to explore aspects of the dynamic relationship between culture and religion.</p><p>Prof. Dr. Hamid Tafazoli<br/><em>Guest Editor</em></p><div><b>Prof. Dr. Hamid Tafazoli</b> is a professor at Bielefeld University.</div><p><b>Submission Planning </b></p><p>Deadline for the submission of abstracts: <strong>15 March </strong><b>2023. </b></p><p>Submission of final manuscripts:<b> 15 June 2023. </b></p><p><b>Submission Criteria: </b> </p><ul><li>Abstract and a short biography should be sent to <strong>Hamid Tafazoli</strong> (<span><a href="mailto:hamid.tafazoli@uni-bielefeld.de">hamid.tafazoli@uni-bielefeld.de</a> </span>) and <strong>Sylvia Hao</strong> (<a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a>)</li><li>Final articles, in English only, should be at least 5000 words long; a 150-word abstract and 5 keywords should also be submitted.  </li><li>Authors can include image files (tables, maps, graphs, photographs …) in ..jpg; they should ensure that images are free of rights (or that rights have been obtained).  </li><li>Each article will be peer-reviewed by at least two anonymous referees.</li></ul><p>For further inquiries, please contact: Sylvia Hao for <em>Arts</em>, <strong>Sylvia Hao</strong> (<a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a>) and Editorial Office of <strong><em>Arts</em></strong>（<a href="mailto:arts@mdpi.com">arts@mdpi.com</a>）</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Sylvia Hao in Beijing Now:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="mailto:sylvia.hao@mdpi.com">sylvia.hao@mdpi.com</a></div></div><p>Editorial Office in Switzerland:</p>

During his travels in Mongolia and China, Karma Pakshi influenced Mӧngke Qan’s social policies and was tortured and imprisoned by Kubilai Qan. In ‘internal exile’ near Xanadu, Karma Pakshi composed several of his philosophical works.</p><p>For online &amp; in-person booking: <a href="https://tickets.ox.ac.uk/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=bodnf&amp;c=jannf" rel="nofollow">https://tickets.ox.ac.uk/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=bodnf&amp;c=jannf</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Charles Manson,</p><p>consultant librarian for Tibetan Studies at the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford University.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:charles.manson@bodleian.ox.ac.uk">charles.manson@bodleian.ox.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://visit.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/event/jan23/the-invention-of-reincarnation" target="_blank">https://visit.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/event/jan23/the-invention-of-reincarnation</a></div></div></div></description>

The aims and methods of liberal education as a pedagogical exercise and a cultural practice need to be examined within the dynamic intellectual, social, economic, and political contexts created by today’s unprecedented movement of peoples and intersections of cultures. Variously seen as forced migration, exile, dislocation, statelessness and even environmentally induced displacement, the Global refugee crises present multilocational and multilayered challenges. This conference aims to create a focused debate around not only the phenomenon of refugee migration but also seeks to understand the crises as within a continuum of other constructions of the refugee as the non-Western Other. This construction leads to the near necessity of speaking of decolonization as an imperative located possibly within liberal education and its practices. The intertwining of the refugee experience with Indigenous communities’ lived experience calls for thoughtful intervention. Can liberal education aid in the process of decolonization? Is it a singular process, or are there multiple ways in which decolonization can occur? What does decolonization look like?</p>
<p>The aims of liberal education are variously articulated as an instrument for the teaching of transferable practical skills, the making and enabling of responsible citizens, or the cultivation of virtue, self- knowledge, and broad, general wisdom. These aims and the means of achieving them all need to be reassessed as our wider society is transformed by both by the infusion of new peoples and the increased engagement of Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The Department of General Education at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and its partner, Medicine Hat College, in Medicine Hat Alberta, Canada and U of Lethbridge invite papers and panel presentations      for our fifth Liberal Education Conference on the theme of <em>Liberal Education in an Era of Migration, Refugee Crises, and Decolonization. </em>Broad topic areas related to this may include, but are not excluded to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the challenges to the historical grounding of liberal education in a time of increased cultural heterogeneity</li>
<li>the place of liberal education in the construction of a common meeting place in society embracing diverse, distinct cultures</li>
<li>the experience of arrival and purposes of liberal education for refugee or recent immigrant</li>
<li>the possibility of a coherent program of liberal education in the absence of a common culture</li>
<li>liberal education as a progressive instrument in the face of hostility to migration, decolonization and cultural diversity</li>
<li>the aims of liberal education in a multi-cultural society</li>
<li>the idea of openness and Liberal Education</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Intersectionality of the refugees and the indigenous communities</li>
<li>International refugee law and the overlap with liberal education</li>
<li>the curriculum of liberal education: which are the great books; or is liberal education dependent on canonical texts, whatever they may be</li>
<li>Decolonization and canonization</li>
<li>pedagogical practice in the presence of cultural diversity — the problems “language proficiency,” cultural capital, and behavioral norms in the classroom</li>
<li>contending cultural norms and the possibility of a general, liberal education</li>
<li>should liberal education be an instrument of social and cultural integration?</li>
<li>trauma, memory and identity formation and how liberal education might address the issues</li>
<li>liberal education and the building of intercultural solidarity</li>
<li>immigration and the infusion; inspiration; and transformation of liberal education</li>
</ul>
<p>We seek abstracts for high quality papers on the conference’s theme, some of the topics we have suggested, or any matters related to ‘liberal education in an era of refugee migration and decolonization’. Please prepare your abstract of no longer than 300 words for blind-review by February 20, 2023.

<li>Name of presenter(s) or panelists</li>
<li>Institutional Affiliation (if any)</li>

			<title>[ June 1, 2023 -  June 2, 2023] Conference or similar: Critical phenomenology of the we</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106817</link>
						<description>Venue: 23.0.49<br/><br/><p>Classical phenomenology offers not only incisive analyses of intentionality, experience, selfhood, empathy and interpersonal understanding, but also quite sophisticated investigations of collective intentionality, affective sharing, social participation, communal experience, and group-identity. Indeed, while starting out with an interest in the individual mind, phenomenologists began exploring dyadic forms of interpersonal relations shortly before the start of World War I, and were deeply engaged in extensive analyses of communal forms of intentionality during the interwar period – at a time when nationalism was on the rise.</p>
<p>Today, the "We" has not lost its place in philosophical, political, or popular discourse. Within the last decade especially, we have witnessed renewed interest in the early phenomenological reflections on group formations, communal experiences, empathy, and fellow-feeling. Does this renewed interest suggest a need to revise our understandings of the "We", or does it attest to its enduring philosophical, social, and political significance/relevance? How have, for instance, perspectives from critical theory and feminist philosophy provided insights into the importance and limitations of questions of belonging, We-experiences, and We-identities? The aim of the current conference is to investigate how this recent critical turn in phenomenology might support, challenge, extend or qualify the classical phenomenological analyses.</p>
<p>Speakers include Alia Al-Saji, Linda Alcoff, Robert Bernasconi, Lisa Guenther, Sara Heinämaa, Steffen Hermann, Sophie Loidolt, Johanna Oksala, Michael Staudigl and Dan Zahavi.</p>

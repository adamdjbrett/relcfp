<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Trust and authority</strong><br/>Studies show that American institutions and elites are experiencing a dramatic loss of authority and trust. Economic inequality, social and spatial segregation and a decaying infrastructure have undermined trust in the fairness and efficiency of political processes. Anti-establishment populism and conspiracy theories resonate widely among the general public. Police brutality has reinforced a deep-seated distrust of authorities among minorities. Commentators and scholars agree that the crisis of trust and authority has been developing for decades and reflects the dissolution of social cohesion and consensus. Many Americans lament the end of the American Dream, the prospect of social upward mobility through hard work and educational achievement. The crisis of authority and trust has also affected U.S. leadership in world politics and the global economy. With support from the German Research Foundation (DFG), the<br/>Heidelberg Center for American Studies formed the Graduiertenkolleg ‚ÄòAuthority and Trust‚Äô (GKAT) to address these questions in interdisciplinary research.</p>
<p><strong>Conference Theme: Practicing Trust and Authority</strong><br/>Some questions arise in the crisis of trust and authority. This conference focuses on the practices of trust and authority. Grounded in theoretical knowledge, we would like to explore with you the actions, processes and strategies that influence trust and authority on various levels.<br/>Some possible questions and topics include (but are not limited to):<br/>‚óè Which practices or actions help build trust in groups?<br/>‚óè How can authority be legitimized?<br/>‚óè How can trust in institutions decline?<br/>‚óè Which interpersonal, governmental and inter-group actions construct trust or authority?<br/>‚óè How can various forms of authority be maintained?<br/>‚óè Authority of researchers, creators, authors<br/>‚óè Role of art and artists in trust-building<br/>‚óè Trustworthiness in organizations and institutions<br/>‚óè (Charismatic) authority in movement leaders</p>
<p>We invite PhD students and early career researchers in the disciplines of literature, history, politics, sociology, geography, religion, media, the arts (in a broader sense), and adjoining research areas to explore these and more questions. The goal of our conference is to assemble practical knowledge that participants can draw from in their private and professional lives. Therefore, we are interested in active and participatory formats ‚Äì audience participation, group works, anything involving the senses, brainstorms, artistic exhibitions or experiments ‚Äì as well as conventional academic formats like paper presentations and panel discussions. The conference is planned to take place in person and in English at the Heidelberg Center for American Studies.</p>
<p><strong>Possible presentation formats</strong><br/>‚óè Traditional Paper &amp; Panel Discussion (90 minutes): At least three presenters and a chair. Papers may be submitted individually or as a fully formed panel. (Chairs may be assigned by the conference committee).<br/>‚óè Performance (30 minutes): Music, theater, game-style, or experimental performances which seek to engage key principles about academic work from various viewpoints and learning objectives.<br/>‚óè Visual Arts Exhibition (assembled on May 12): Museum-style exhibitions, photography, comics, or art pieces to be displayed at the HCA. A great option for those who can‚Äôt participate in person.</p>
<p><strong>Submitting a proposal</strong><br/>Please submit your proposal (in English) via email to <a href="mailto:gkat-conference2023@hca.uni-heidelberg.de">gkat-conference2023@hca.uni-heidelberg.de</a> by <strong>February 5, 2023</strong>.<br/>‚óè For individual paper proposals, please submit an abstract (max. 250 words) and a short CV.<br/>‚óè For panel proposals, please submit a short panel abstract (max. 250 words) for a session of 90 min. The application should also include a list of participants, titles of individual papers, individual paper abstracts (max. 250 words) and short CVs of all participants.<br/>‚óè For performance and visual arts exhibitions proposals, please submit an abstract (max. 400 words) and a short CV. We also encourage you to send us a link to your additional audio/video/image material.</p>
<p>Applicants will be notified by the end of March.</p>
<p>We plan to publish the presented papers and projects in subsequent conference proceedings. No conference fee or registration fee will be charged. Limited funds for travel and accommodation expenses are available upon request. Please indicate on your submission if you would like to be considered. The conference committee will get in touch.</p>

A distinguished and decades-old - but still rather limited - field has undertaken research in the other direction, noting that China has also influenced its neighbors, Europe, and the wider world in turn. Nonetheless, this perspective remains dispersed, eclectic, and little-theorized. This gathering‚Äôs questions will extend in two directions: the historicization and theorization of what one might call ‚Äòearly modern Sinicization.‚Äô</p><p>Unearthing the many types of ‚Äòreverse diffusionism‚Äô in which Chinese practices spread to the world has rich explanatory promise, and may even be essential in achieving a more balanced understanding of causation in global history. On the one hand, this conference invites scholarship which explores how regions close and far from China transformed, adapted to, and struggled against Sinicization in the so-called early modern period, very roughly defined here as 1400-1800.</p><p>On the other hand, this conference also invites reflections on how to characterize ‚ÄòSinicization‚Äô itself. We also invite scholarship which poses major methodological, sociological, and even ethical questions about Sinicization, including:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Which sociological categories should we use to describe these many tendencies and processes (‚Äòcreolization,‚Äô ‚Äòinterculturation,‚Äô ‚Äòhybridization,‚Äô ‚Äòentanglement,‚Äô ‚Äòimpact- response,‚Äô ‚Äòhegemony,‚Äô ‚Äòco-colonization,‚Äô the ‚ÄòChina-centered approach,‚Äô etc.)?</p><p>‚Ä¢ How to navigate the pratfalls of accidental Eurocentrism, uncritical Sinophilia, and<br/>essentialization of European and East Asian societies?</p><p>‚Ä¢ How to include the stories of smaller polities, indigenous peoples, dynamic and creative<br/>individuals, and others caught between Europeanization, Sinicization, and other powerful<br/>social currents?</p><p><strong>DATES: </strong>15-17 June, 2023<br/><strong>INSTITUTION: </strong>University of T√ºbingen<br/><strong>LOCATION:</strong> T√ºbingen, Germany<br/><strong>LANGUAGE of presentations:</strong> English<br/><strong>APPLICATION DEADLINE:</strong> January 31, 2023<br/><strong>FORMAT:</strong> Hybrid; in-person and online¬†</p><p><strong>ORGANIZERS: </strong>Prof. Dr. Renate D√ºrr, PD Dr. Philip Hahn, &amp;amp; Dr. Adrian Masters<br/><strong>SPONSORS:</strong> The German Research Foundation‚Äôs SFB 923-F04 and the University of T√ºbingen</p><p><em>Funding is available for travel and accommodations.

Implicit and explicit approval of antisemitism is tolerated or supported now by people with serious power. At the same time, there are fierce debates, particularly among Jews, about what exactly constitutes antisemitism. At the center of these debates are Zionism and Israel and Palestine: when does critique of Israel or Zionism cross the line into antisemitism? These two phenomena commingle to characterize the historical condition of antisemitism in today‚Äôs American society.

<p>The American Religion and Literature Society (ARLS) invites papers for a panel at the American Literature Association Conference, May 25-28, 2023 in Boston.</p>
<p>We are seeking papers that explore the relevance of Midrash to contemporary literary criticism.</p>
<p>Midrash teaches that there exists not one authoritative meaning that we must discover but many possible meanings in whose unfolding we must participate. We see this happening in Talmud: a midrashic reader responds to a gap in the text by creating a narrative, which is, as Sandor Goodhart describes it, ‚Äúa material extension‚Äù of the original text. The reader looks in between words, as well as in the space between God and man, in keeping with the rabbinic belief that meaning comes to be in dialogue between man and God. In this panel, we seek to consider how some of the attitudes and practices of ancient Midrash find echoes in contemporary theories of literary reading. Consider reader-response arguments that a text is not self-formulated but, rather, actualized through interpretation. Consider poststructuralist models in which the structure of language itself is interrogated and separated from the functioning of the literary.</p>
<p>We welcome papers that address questions including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>What critical approaches seem to take cues from or reinstate midrashic patterns? Or, where do you see correspondences between Jewish hermeneutics and secular criticism?
</li>
<li>How can an understanding of Midrash enrich our engagement with literary texts?
</li>
<li>How can the midrashic mode inform efforts to make meaning in a post-Holocaust, poststructuralist, or postmodern age, when structures of meaning have failed or been deconstructed?
</li>
<li>Does midrashic reading open up avenues for literary reading of sacred texts (as argued by Geoffrey Hartman)?
</li>
<li>What has been the lasting impact of what David Stern named ‚Äúthe midrash-theory connection‚Äù that was expressed during the 1980s?¬†</li>
</ul>
<p>Please submit a 350-word paper¬†proposal¬†and short bio to¬†<a href="mailto:kludwig@bsu.edu" target="_blank">kludwig@bsu.edu</a>¬†by January 6, 2023.</p>

White (Brigham Young University)<br/>Brett Patterson<br/>James William Lincoln (University of Kentucky)<br/><br/><p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender and Philosophy¬†</em>brings to the fore the Eastern, Western, and Indigenous philosophies that are implicit in the show.

The volume is also unique in drawing on less common traditions such as black abolitionism, anarchism, feminist care ethics, and the philosophy of martial arts. Intertwining experience and reflection,¬†<em>Avatar: The Last Airbender and Philosophy</em>¬†helps readers to deeply engage with today‚Äôs burning questions, such as how to deal with ecological destruction, the aftermath of colonialism and genocide, and wealth inequality, using the tools from a wide range of philosophical traditions.</p>

This is not an imposition of Greek thinking, but an integration and transformation of Greek thinking in a Jewish context.¬† By understanding the breadth and depth of the entanglement of cultures, we can open up pathways and see growth and development in a tradition that was said to be closed off from abstract thinking and fractured from its surrounding culture.¬† Professor Najman will argue that this was not the case.¬† Rather, that Judaism, Hebrew, and the growth of new textual traditions continue to exhibit vitality and creative innovation throughout the Hellenistic period and beyond.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Hindy Najman is the Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture and the Director of the Oriel Centre for the Study of the Bible at the University of Oxford.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>She has written on the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rabbinic Literature and Pseudepigrapha.¬† Her publications include¬†<i>Seconding Sinai: The Development of Mosaic Discourse in Second Temple Judaism </i>(2003),¬†</span></span></span><span><span><span>¬†<i>Past Renewals: Interpretive Authority,¬†Renewed Revelation and the Quest for Perfection¬†</i>(2010<i>) and ¬†Losing the Temple and Recovering the Future: An Analysis of 4 Ezra</i></span></span></span><span><span><span>¬†(2014). ¬†She is currently completing a new book entitled:¬†</span></span></span><i><span><span><span>Reading Practices and the Vitality of Scripture</span></span></span></i><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info:¬†</div><div><div><p>UCL INstitute of Jewish Studies</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email:¬†</div><div><div><a href="mailto:ijs@ucl.ac.uk">ijs@ucl.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL:¬†</div><div><div><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/478135364747" target="_blank">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/478135364747</a></div></div></div></description>

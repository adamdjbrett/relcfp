			<title>[ December 13, 2022] Conference or similar: Saint Francis' Legacy of Peace for Our Times</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/103438</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>We are living in complex times and contexts that affect our perception of many areas of life, from security, politics, economics, ecology to ecclesiology.

The conference aims to recall the impulses from Franciscan sources and to contextualize them in the problems of today's globalized world. The conference is sponsored by the St. Francis Ways Project. In addition to physical journeys (camino), the project team try to find inspiration in the figure of St. Francis of Assisi virtually, through encounters of people whom Francis inspires to understand the good and beautiful human life. The planned conference is based on the conviction that the physical and virtual ways to St. Francis lead to a meaningful goal.</p>

Taking contemporary visual and performing arts as a vantage point of observation, it explores what common grounds are being formed among today’s arts, community resilience, environmental stewardship, and ontological inquiries when artists work with local communities in practicing and politicizing ritual dancing, chanting, rhyming, object-making, trance, healing, and worshiping, among other spiritual traditions. We seek insightful interpretations of such alliance from multiple ontological, sociopolitical, and ecospiritual perspectives—for example, how it enlivens diverse cosmological worlds in Asia and their biocultural manifestations in local ecosystems; what ways of mediation between humans, nonhuman species, potent geographies, and incorporeal beings it offers; how such mediations shape the experience and expressions of more-than-human sociality; and how these processes empower local communities’ political and ethical responses to the Anthropocenic climate change, biocultural extinction, and other forms of slow violence. The panel encourages scholars, art practitioners, activists, and community members from Asia to work collaboratively in bringing spiritual issues into visibility and intelligibility.</p>
<p>The theme of this panel may be addressed in relation to, but not limited by, the following issues:</p>
<p>• Communal, ecological, and cosmopolitical roles of spiritual practices<br/>• Inheritance and transformation of indigenous and folk spiritual traditions<br/>• Intersections between contemporary artistic media and spiritual mediumship<br/>• The spiritual and more-than-human turn of visual and performing arts<br/>• Spiritual practices as means of more-than-human/biosemiotic communication<br/>• Spiritual and artistic mediation of diverse cosmological/ontological worlds<br/>• Spirits, afterlives, and nonlives as historical and political agents of the Anthropocene<br/>• Channeling materiality and spirituality in ecoartistic analyses</p>
<p>Please submit your proposal for a 15-minute presentation (within 300 words) and a brief bio (within 200 words) by 5 December 2022 to be considered for the panel. Submissions and questions can be directed to <a href="mailto:artsnecospirituality@gmail.com">artsnecospirituality@gmail.com</a>.</p>

To be sure, it is often assumed that being religious is synonymous (ontologically) with being black and African. This essentialization of black culture is problematic because there is a growing number of black Americans who have chosen to set religion or spirituality aside, and in some cases, they are doing it openly as a matter of protest. Considering the changing trajectory of religious thought and expression in the United States, there are also many black Americans who have expressed interests in non-Abrahamic frameworks that do not include worshiping a deity such as Humanism, Pantheism, and the nontheist sects of Buddhism and Hinduism. Likewise, the US has seen an increase in organizations that are black and secular (e.g., Black Skeptics, Black Nonbelievers, Black Freethinkers, Black People Beyond Belief, and Affinis Humanity Coalition), and most of these groups have been established and managed by black women, who tend to be one of the most religious demographics in the US. These women have made it possible for those who are without reliance or dependence upon religion or god(s) to say so in public and in private. We believe that this organizational aspect is significant and represents a critical part of the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement that is often overlooked because of the role that Christianity <em>had</em> to play in the Movement’s mission. Consequently, there is an emerging cadre of writers, activists, and scholars who have been associated with these groups and are willing to be seen and heard as black nones or even atheists (e.g., Affinis, Norm Allen, Jamila Bey, Christopher Cameron, Candace Gorham, Sikivu Hutchinson, Anthony Pinn, Mandisa Thomas, Kim Veal, and Ayanna Watson).</p>
<p>We believe that this new wave of black expression is part of a larger social movement in the U.S. where individuals and collectives are unapologetically moving away from traditional religious expression. This collection is a clarion call that the terms for black expression and perhaps for social justice could take on greater depth and meaning for the next generation who may be less likely to embrace or stay loyal to traditional black religious and social frameworks that deny the full expression of their humanity. Thus, in this call for papers, we invite scholars, writers, artists, activists, former and current clergy, health professionals, and anyone interested in examining the identity of black Nones in America to submit abstracts for this collection. Given that some of the greatest cultural icons of America and black America, such as Octavia E. Butler, bell hooks, Langston Hughes, A. Phillip Randolph, Alice Walker, and many others did not stay committed to religious or spiritual frameworks that did not support the full humanity of black people, we seek works that will openly challenge dominant ways of thinking about the relationship between blackness and religiosity. We hope to edit and publish an anthology that will demonstrate that belief in a god is not a requirement for black advancement or for one to be authentically black, since blackness is multi-faceted and constantly evolving. </p>
<p><strong>Submissions:</strong> An abstract (250-500 words) is due December 15, 2022. If the abstract is accepted, the complete paper (3,500–6,500 words) or work of art is due August 1, 2023.  Please include your full name, institutional affiliation, tentative title, and email address (not included in the 250-500 text limit) at the beginning of your file.

Danforth Center, Washington University in St. Louis</p><p>Dates: 30 May-1 June, 2023</p><p>What is the relationship between politics and religion, political commitment and religious commitment in the work of Simone Weil? To what extent does Weil’s theology influence her politics, and her politics influence her theology—and how might attention to this question change how we read Weil today? How does Weil separate questions of Church from questions of religion, and what can our answers to these questions tell us about connections between Church and State in the U.S.? This workshop will consider these and other questions about Simone Weil’s political theology and inquiries emerging from it.</p><p>This workshop will be held at the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis. In keeping with the Center’s focus on scholarly and public engagement with issues at the intersection of politics and religion in the United States, we invite reflection on Weil that considers her thought in dialogue with religious life in the U.S. While Weil kept her eyes largely on her native France, she spent the summer and early fall of 1942 in New York, where she conducted research at public libraries in order to “dig into the hidden recesses of theology.” Weil’s thought has been influential for leading U.S. public intellectuals, from Susan Sontag and Mary McCarthy to Christian Wiman, Christy Wampole, and others today.</p><p>The conference will convene at the John C. Danforth Center on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, where lodging will be available for participants. Additional travel grants will also be available.</p><p>We call for proposals of works in progress, more polished moments of ongoing inquiries, experimental projects, and other approaches to thinking together about the above questions and contexts.</p><p>Please send your 500-word abstracts on Weil and political theology to Fannie Bialek and Ben Davis by November 15, 2022. Emails: abialek[at]wustl.edu and benjamin.davis.1[at]slu.edu.</p></div></div></div></description>

			<title>[ March 31, 2023 -  April 1, 2023] Conference or similar: Philosophy of religion in Asia</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/103290</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The Veritas Research Center (at UIC, Yonsei University) is hosting a workshop on the philosophy of religion, which will be held in a hybrid format in Seoul/online on March 31 (Friday)/April 1 (Saturday) 2023.</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to diversify and globalize philosophy of religion. As it stands, philosophy of religion has traditionally tended to pay particular attention to philosophical questions arising within and about Christianity. Moreover, leading English philosophy of religion journals tend to receive far more submissions from English-speaking parts of the world. At the same time, philosophy of religion is a broad field that encompasses philosophically relevant questions arising within and about any religious tradition and about religion(s) in general. Relatedly, journals such as the <em>Journal of Analytic Theology</em>, <em>Religious Studies</em>, and the <em>International Journal for Philosophy of Religion</em> are seeking more submissions from non-English-speaking parts of the world. Thus, the field has much potential to continue its ongoing efforts to globalize and diversify.</p>
<p>In addition to talks on any topic of the philosophy of religion, the workshop will include a <strong>Publication Seminar</strong> held by Prof. Helen De Cruz, Executive Editor of the <em>Journal of Analytic Theology. </em>This seminar is aimed at early career researchers and doctoral students across Asia who are interested in publishing in leading English philosophy of religion journals. The seminar will offer practical advice on how to make a paper ready for submission (e.g., cover letter, formatting), where and how to submit, how to increase the odds that your paper survives the desk review stage, when to query an editor, etc.</p>
<p>We invite abstracts of between 150 and 300 words on any topic in philosophy of religion(s), broadly construed. We particularly encourage early career researchers working in Asia to apply.</p>
<p>Please send your abstract as an email attachment, with the subject line ‘Philosophy of Religion in Asia’ to <a href="mailto:nataljadeng@yonsei.ac.kr">nataljadeng at yonsei.ac.kr</a> by 23:59 (KST) on November 30 2022. Papers should be suitable for a 20-30 minute presentation. In the body of the email, please indicate (a) your current affiliation, and (b) whether you would prefer to present in person or online. (Please note that we cannot offer travel funding, so that you should only indicate that you prefer to present in person if you have travel funding or are based in Seoul or its surroundings.)</p>
<p>In case of questions, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:nataljadeng@yonsei.ac.kr">nataljadeng at yonsei.ac.kr</a></p>
<p>The event is jointly sponsored by Prof. <strong>Yujin Nagasawa</strong>’s Global Philosophy of Religion Project at the University of Birmingham (<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.global-philosophy.org/__;!!K543PA!OpbVpEmmnkasi-MEbQtSTI1olToT2CclUhFgqSHti4M3f_vpPjP-_WLmPgSEHQVeiF2I1NPlJ9DDCfsS%24">https://www.global-philosophy.org/</a>) and the Veritas Research Center, Underwood International College (UIC), Yonsei University.</p></description>

She witnesses the roles Quakers played in colonization and the forced assimilation of native children by means of the Quaker industrial boarding schools.

<p> </p>
<p>The Marilynne Robinson Society at the ALA is seeking papers that examine the author’s relationship to American evangelicalism.  Robinson’s spiritual vision has been shaped by the writings of Jonathan Edwards, who is considered to be the founding father of American evangelicalism.  How does Robinson’s body of work lead us to think critically about the evangelical tradition in the United States?  How do her essays and novels, particularly <em>Gilead</em>, provide a counter-narrative to the discourses found in modern and contemporary American evangelicalism?  In what ways can they respond to the incisive diagnosis presented by Kristen Du Mez’s recent book, <em>Jesus and John Wayne</em>, a text that examines the connection between American evangelicalism, Christian nationalism, rugged masculinity, and political power? How might Robinson’s novels and essays in conversation with Du Mez’s <em>Jesus and John Wayne</em> illuminate our understanding of the evangelical tradition in the United States?  These are some of the questions that the panel seeks to address.</p>
<p>The annual American Literature Association (ALA) conference will take place in Boston, MA, May 25-28, 2023.  </p>
<p>Please submit a 350-word paper proposal and short bio to <a href="mailto:haein.park@biola.edu">haein.park@biola.edu</a> by November 15, 2022. </p>

Lewis</em></strong><strong>, Call for Chapters</strong></p>
<p>An edited collection tentatively titled “Going to the Movies with C.S. Lewis” is seeking chapter submissions. The book is expected to be published through Cambridge Scholars Publishing. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Having been born many years after C.S. Lewis died I of course never had the opportunity to watch a movie with the man. However, over the years I feel, as many others probably feel as well, like Lewis accompanies me as I watch movies, read books, attend church services, and make other daily pursuits. Lewis’ works shape my thinking on many theological, educational, and cultural matters like few other authors’ works do.</p>
<p>This book is an attempt to take some of those insights from C.S. Lewis and apply them to film studies. It will explore the thought and theology of C.S. Lewis by connecting his work with film theory, specific films, and adaptations of his work. In many ways it is a book meant to explore how Lewis’ thought can help us view films.</p>
<p>The following categories are meant to act as general guidance for sections of the book:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploring Film Theory with C.S. Lewis</li>
<li>Exploring Individual Films with C.S. Lewis</li>
<li>Analyzing Lewis’ Life through Films of About Lewis</li>
<li>Analyzing Lewis’ Fiction through Adaptations of his works</li>
</ol>
<p>Some chapter ideas that would fit into the above categories include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Four Loves on film</li>
<li>Lewis’ approach to literature as a guide to approaching film</li>
<li>“On the Reading of Old Books” and On the Watching of Old Movies</li>
<li>Lewis’ idea of fantasy in relation to particular films</li>
<li>Ideas in his essays or books that relate to film studies, film theory, or individual films</li>
<li>The many different Narnia adaptations (comparisons between the versions or examinations of particular films as adaptations of the original stories)</li>
<li>Lewis’ thoughts on Christmas and Christmas movies (what would Lewis think of Hallmark Christmas movies?)</li>
<li>Lewis portrayed on film – how does this change the way he is viewed?</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, these are only suggestions. Anything connecting Lewis’ thought with the cinema will be considered.  </p>
<p><strong>Submission Procedure</strong></p>
<p>Please submit a chapter proposal by March 31, 2024 which includes the following: title, abstract, and a short biography of the author(s). Proposals should be a maximum of 500 words written in English, using Microsoft Word format, Times New Roman, 12 pt. font. Please send the Word document as an attachment to the book editor (Bryan Mead, <a href="mailto:bmead@etbu.edu">bmead@etbu.edu</a>). Authors of accepted proposals will be notified and sent specific submission guidelines. Chapter contributions should be at least 4,000 words and will follow Chicago style (footnotes and bibliography). Submissions are welcome from early career researchers and established scholars.</p>
<p>If your proposal is accepted, chapter submissions will be due by September 15, 2024. Proposal acceptance does not guarantee chapter’s inclusion in the book.</p>
<p>Editor Information: Bryan Mead, Ph.D, is Assistant Professor of English at East Texas Baptist University where he teaches film studies, literature, and composition. He is the author of <em>Writing in Film Studies, From Professional Practice to Practical Pedagogy</em> (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2024).

<p>Journal: The Predicate Volume VII, An Academic Journal by the English Graduate Student Association of Georgetown University</p>
<p>Submission Deadline: March 22th</p>
<p>Maladies, broadly construed as an illness or sickness, have formed the foundation of countless theoretical and philosophical conundrums. From Hippocrates to Helen Bequaert Holmes, these questions have led to solutions that have shaped the way we have come to view maladies as inherently interdisciplinary, requiring a community effort to ponder, analyze, and attempt to solve. In light of recent times, the need to continue these conversations has intensified. This journal seeks to foster an interdisciplinary dialogue between fields (but not limited to) such as literature, disability studies, philosophy, and the medical humanities within the combined thematic, theoretical and critical orientation provided by “malady.”</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:<br/>● Illnesses of the body and/or the mind<br/>● Disability studies<br/>● Social maladies<br/>● Bad readings<br/>● Environmental maladies<br/>● Apocalypse<br/>● Health and healing<br/>● Rethinking the Body<br/>● Resistance and Resilience<br/>● Sensationalism/Sentimentality<br/>● Spirituality</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines:<br/>● Your essay must be submitted in the format of a Word Document or Googledoc. PDF’s<br/>will not be accepted.<br/>● Please cite your essay in accordance with MLA, Chicago, or APA formatting.<br/>● Word count limit of 5000 words.<br/>Please make sure your submissions meet the required formatting standards. Any entries that do not adhere to the requirements will not be considered for inclusion in <em>The Predicate</em>. Submissions can be sent to Caroline Hannum (<a href="mailto:cmh385@georgetown.edu">cmh385@georgetown.edu</a>) or Sarah Licht<br/>(<a href="mailto:sbl60@georgetown.edu">sbl60@georgetown.edu</a>).

						<description>Publication Name: Crossing borders. De Martino and the Arts <br/><br/><p><strong>CoSMo. <em>Comparative Studies in Modernism</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ojs.unito.it/index.php/COSMO">http://www.ojs.unito.it/index.php/COSMO</a></p>
<p><strong>CROSSING BORDERS: </strong><strong>DE MARTINO AND THE ARTS</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>N.26 (June 2025) </p>
<p><strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>Call For Papers</strong></p>
<p>In recent times, scholarly research on <strong>Ernesto De Martino</strong>’s work has given rise to a forceful revision of the intellectual and scientific figure we had inherited from previous years, starting from the fifties up to at least the end of the past century. Relevant insights have emerged from a new comprehensive view of De Martino’s oeuvre, when scholars started exploring areas lying outside the author’s specific fields of research, such as folklore, magic, myth, and under-privileged cultures. Fresh interpretations have revealed a structurally open-ended and problematical kind of work, impelling scholars to revise its meanings and limits. So modern has De Martino’s cultural enterprise proved as to stimulate people from diverse horizons and cultures to reinterpret and translate his work, performing a “translating gesture” (Charuty), which retroacts on, and enhances his original texts with new perspectives, and moving from one language to another has widened possible readings of his texts. International conferences have added new aspects to the interdisciplinary nature of his explorations, and widened the range of his reception. On the literary side, De Martino is known to be critical, yet fascinated by European “crisis” literature, i.e., the great modernist artistic creations. Although some trends and authors from early and late twentieth century are not part of his preferences, one can reasonably and fruitfully investigate upon the astonishing and remarkable affinities connecting him with our recent and contemporary scene, not only on the Italian side, as Carlo Ginzburg has demonstrated.</p>
<p>Therefore, one could reasonably conjecture that De Martino’s theoretical and methodological experimental thinking has been somehow grounded in, and moulded by the various artistic languages he employed in his research. Whether recording the forms of popular and vernacular singing, of mourning lamentations, or musical cathartic rituals, De Martino constantly comes to rely on all sorts of aesthetic practices which, incidentally, are not foreign to his “theatrical calling”, i.e., his readiness to understand and display human frailties, with important consequences for the manifold artistic practices related to such experiences. It goes without saying that in order to retrieve and report on the forms of cultural heritage of the peoples he was studying, De Martino necessarily made use of direct field recordings of oral testimonies, employed photography and film in order to both chronicle and circulate his research, deftly rehearsing and anticipating, if unwittingly, the artistic side of such practices: one can only think of American and European photography, reportage and film-reportage of l’ <em>entre-deux guerres</em>, which not only chronicled but invented the realities they were engaged in. Likewise, he would resort to radio broadcasting (1953-54) to publicize his works’ more specialistic topics among a wider audience, thus experimenting in several artistic techniques introduced by the new media and paralleling the new forms of theatrical performance, that enriched, or were still enriching the range of new artistic fields in the twentieth century (reportage, montage, cinema, photography, performance). In all this, De Martino enhances the very peculiarities of each aesthetic language, thanks to his keen sensibility for the <strong><em>concrete</em> <em>plurality</em></strong> of artistic practices, the specificity of their <strong><em>media</em></strong>, the new formal solutions and techniques required to achieve new ranges of expression. To sum up, De Martino <strong><em>encounters</em></strong> various kinds of aesthetic languages, he constantly <strong><em>implements</em></strong><em> </em>them so that they may further his research, and <strong><em>studies</em></strong> them as relevant documents both in their historical and their anthropological status.</p>
<p>All these areas will be dealt with in a <strong><em>CoSMo</em></strong> <strong>issue </strong>by the title <strong><em>De Martino and the Arts/De Martino e le arti </em></strong>due to appear in June 2025. The editors invite proposals for papers focusing on the crossroads between various clusters of themes, various traditions, disciplinary areas, and points of interest, in English, Italian, or French. We encourage contributions to “cross borders”, venturing in unexpected ground, discovering unforeseeable links and original parallels, starting from the assumption that possible new interpretations of De Martino’s works may profit from a sustained attention to recent, or less recent exploits in the world of art. Proposals may centre around the wider domains of <strong><em>Word, Image, Performance</em></strong>, covering the more specific fields of life writing, reportage, cinema, photography, music, visual arts, performance, etc.. We will consider proposals addressing, but not limited to, the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>   De Martino’s engagement in visual culture: photography, painting, visual studies</li>
<li>   “Realism effects” and pictographic language</li>
<li>   Performance and body language: symbolic and performative aspects of ritual</li>
<li>   De Martino and cinema : influences, uses, anticipations</li>
<li>   De Martino’s themes in contemporary art</li>
<li>  Translating De Martino: at the crossroads between literary language and invention of new concepts</li>
<li>   Travelogue, stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and association of ideas</li>
<li>   Montage techniques</li>
<li>  Ethnography and life writing; autobiographic style, facing others and the Other</li>
<li>  Demartino’s analysis of art in comparison with contemporary and later aesthetic theories</li>
<li>   Psychotic occurrences, impersonality, the decentred “I” in literature</li>
<li>   De Martino and many-faceted forms of music</li>
<li>   Improbable, unexpected connections: ideas, authors, experiences</li>
<li>   Aesthetic languages and spiritual pathologies: art, creativity, madness</li>
<li>   De Martino’s international reception.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in submitting a paper, please let us have a <strong>short abstract (250 words)</strong> in English along with a brief bio-bibliography, by <strong>15 June 2024</strong>, sending it to the issue’s editors’ addresses:</p>
<p>Roberto Dainotto  (<a href="mailto:dainotto@duke.edu">dainotto@duke.edu</a>),</p>

We move in leaps, in fits, at times dragged, but we move forward all the same, sharp-stung by a tension our unique self-awareness gives us: the need to tear down and rebuild and the certainty to find it haunted by those same old ghosts. History reveals a constant cycle of destruction and renewal. Sometimes outside forces press change upon us: the hand of God scattering the nations at Babel or the devastation wrought by the Black Death in fourteenth-century Europe. Sometimes our own innovation kickstarts the change: the printing press, the Industrial Revolution, the iPhone. Consider the foment of ideas: twin desires for rebellion against established government, the one American, colored by reluctant but resolved arms, the other French, bitter and bloody. We acknowledge that sometimes the old must go to make room for the new. And yet, we ask: what to tear down, what to leave? When Abraham Lincoln resolved to submit the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, he did so with the conviction that the United States could no longer endure the peculiar institution. Slavery, a blight upon the nation, deserved its burial. In 1996, the federal government passed the Defense of Marriage Act, which codified the definition of marriage as that existing between a man and a woman. The traditional view of marriage, it argued, must be preserved. The Respect for Marriage Act would later repeal this law in 2022. The old definition, it argued, no longer held. </p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">The Christian faith sits at the heart of this tension as an anchorage in the face of perpetual mutability. If certain truths about God, about humanity, and about the world prove universal, then progress cannot proceed unchecked. What must be torn down or built or restored must do so in the light of Christ. </p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizers invite those interested to submit a paper within their discipline concerning any elements of destruction and renewal. Consider the following suggested paper topics: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Education: the American Education system continues to show symptoms of decay, with declining rates in reading and math and increasing rates of absenteeism. What must change to correct course for students across the United States? </p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Literature: What elements of destruction or renewal do we see in literature, in its mechanics or its themes?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Business: The Western World continues to flirt with socialism despite capitalism’s proven history of success and socialism’s, well, lack of success, for want of a better word. What must change–or not–within our markets to ensure healthy economic development?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Political Science: Recent research seems to suggest that the majority of voters favor a strict popular vote over the safeties of the electoral college. What voting process best ensures a fair election reflecting the will of the people?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Criminal Justice: Criminal Justice reform remains a foremost concern among American citizens, but how to approach said reforms? Defund? Refund? Reallocate? The real-life consequences for missteps cannot be underappreciated. </p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Computer Science: ChatGPT went live in November 2022. In 2023, hundreds of industry leaders, Elon Musk among them, called for a temporary pause in development related to AI systems. Can anything curb AI development? Should anything? What precautions should be taken before AI becomes fully adopted by society? </p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Physics: The demand for greater, more efficient, and cleaner sources of energy continues to drive national and international concerns. What sources of energy must we–can we–abandon? What alternative avenues should we pursue and when?  </p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Health Sciences: More than three years have lapsed since the Covid pandemic began. What have we learned? What must be reformed to mitigate such harm in the future? </p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bible: The Church faces a challenging circumstance as a Kingdom rooted in the eternal but playing out in the particular. Where is it acceptable for the particular to shift or fall away? Where has the particular broken–or strained to the point of breaking–with the eternal?  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">All article submissions should be approximately 3,000 to 9,000 words in length including footnotes, 12-pt font, Times New Roman, double-spaced, and should follow The Chicago Manual of Style (15th Edition). All submissions should also include an abstract of the manuscript (under 150 words). The author’s name, address (including email address), title, and institutional affiliation should appear only on a removable cover page. All submissions will be reviewed by an appropriate blind-peer group of readers. Submissions should include an electronic email with a document attachment in MS Word. Hard copy submissions will not be returned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All authors of accepted manuscripts will be notified promptly and will receive a complimentary copy of the Journal. We do reserve the right to edit manuscripts for usage and style. Accepted manuscripts are also subject to editorial modifications with consultation and permission of the author. </p>
<p>Please submit articles by June 1st, 2024 to Dr. Taten Shirley at <a href="mailto:tshirley@faulkner.edu">tshirley@faulkner.edu</a>.</p>

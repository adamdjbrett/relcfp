Finding this a good occasion to re-visit Troeltsch’s work together with its broader context the Chair for Sociology of Religion at the Pedagogical University of Cracow would like to invite for the international conference <i>The (social) science of religion: Troeltsch, Weber, Simmel and others</i>. The main idea of the conference is to acknowledge and re-consider Troeltsch’s (rarely appreciated) role within the “visionary company” of great social scientists dealing with religion in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. What we attempt is broad and interdisciplinary reflection in which Troeltsch’s theological, philosophical and sociological approach together with the work of his contemporaries constitutes a point of departure. Submissions from sociologists, historians, theologians or philosophers are welcome. Different approaches to the main theme, both appreciative and critical, debates around heritage and questions of possible meanings that the “social science of religion” may have for (and in) our time – all this is of utmost interest to us. The list of possible topics includes:    </span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Troeltsch as a theologian and social scientist. Troeltsch has usually been treated as a theologian only while his contributions to social sciences or philosophy of religion have been overlooked or simply forgotten. But this is as much pigeonholing as treating Weber solely as a “classic of sociology”. In fact what both Troeltsch and Weber offer is a broad synthesis of theology, sociology, history and philosophy.     </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Troeltsch and his contemporaries – mutual inspirations and influences. Troeltsch has long been in the shadow of Weber and only recently was the importance of his work for social sciences and our reflection on modernity re-discovered. The same more or less can be said of Simmel.       </span></span></span></p><p><span><span> - </span></span><span><span><span>Troeltsch’s multidisciplinary “science of religion” among similar projects by Weber, Simmel Durkheim or James.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Visions of modernity and secularization in the writings of Troeltsch, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, Émile Durkheim or William James: parallels and differences.      </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Protestant Reformation in the writings of Troeltsch and Weber. The mutual influence of Troeltsch’s account of the birth of modernity out of the spirit of Protestantism and Weber’s theses about Reformation and capitalism is now indisputable. The question which may be asked today is which of these two accounts seem more relevant and inspiring from today’s perspective.  </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Mutual interactions between theology and social sciences in Troeltsch and other representatives of the “science of religion”.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Religion, historical consciousness and the question of values in Troeltsch and in the social science of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- The question of “public function” and political responsibilities of both social science and theology according to Troeltsch, Weber, Simmel or James. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The conference will be held on 1-2 June 2023</b><b> </b>at the Pedagogical University of Cracow in Cracow, Poland. The precise venue will be announced later.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>Abstracts of max. 300 words together with a short cv should be sent to: </span></span><span><span><b><a href="mailto:science.of.religion.conference@gmail.com">science.of.religion.conference@gmail.com</a>.</b></span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The deadline for abstracts is 28 February 2023</b><b>. </b>Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their submissions by <b>15 March 2023</b>.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>Conference languages are English and Polish.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b><u>Fee options:</u></b></span></span></p><p><span><span>1) 50 EUR – participation on-site </span></span></p><p><span><span>2) 80 EUR – participation + lunches on June 1 and 2</span></span></p><p><span><span>3) 100 EUR – participation + lunches + conference dinner on June 1</span></span></p><p><span><span>Abstract submitters are kindly asked to choose one of the options.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>All other costs, including transport and accommodation, should be covered separately by the participants.

			<title>[ June 22, 2023 -  June 24, 2023] Conference or similar: International David Foster Wallace Society 2023</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106009</link>
						<description>Venue: 300 N. Washington St.<br/><br/><p>DFW 23 Gettysburg</p>
<p><strong>International David Foster Wallace Society 2023</strong></p>
<p> “The Subject and Art” <strong>Call for Abstracts</strong> Gettysburg College <strong>June 22 – 24, 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conference Director: </strong>Vernon W. Cisney,</p>
<p>Chair and Associate Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies, Gettysburg College</p>
<p><strong>Keynote Speaker:</strong></p>
<p>Lee Konstantinou, Associate Professor of English, University of Maryland, College Park</p>
<p>Author of <em>The Last Samurai Reread</em> and <em>Cool Characters: Irony and American Fiction</em></p>
<p>The Gettysburg College Interdisciplinary Studies Department is delighted to announce the 2023 conference of the International David Foster Wallace Society, entitled “The Subject and Art.” Wallace famously considered his task as an author to be the exploration of what it means to be human. His work centers on fundamental, life-and-death questions having to do with intimacy, spirituality, and authenticity, as well as the darker existential dimensions of depression, loneliness, addiction, and death. He considered literature’s purpose to be the fostering of connections, opening spaces of intersubjectivity, and activating pathways of emotional affirmation. His writing is distinctively American, but it delves into aspects of life universal to the human experience. His body of work therefore provides a fecund field of inquiry for questions pertaining to the relations between subjectivity, intersubjectivity, and the arts.</p>
<p>The 2023 David Foster Wallace Conference will be held on the beautiful campus of Gettysburg College in historic Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, just one hour from Baltimore and ninety minutes from Washington, D.C. In the true spirit of the liberal arts, we invite submissions of abstracts from across the spectrum of academic disciplines.</p>
<p>Suggested questions and topics include, but are certainly not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What possibilities and limitations does language create for human connection? How does literature mitigate these limitations?</li>
<li>The role of masks and veils in Wallace’s work.</li>
<li>Different models of subjectivity in <em>Infinite Jest</em>.</li>
<li>Wallace as a critic of neoliberalism (<em>The Pale King</em>, for instance).</li>
<li>Wallace’s treatments of difference(s) (racial, sexual, socioeconomic, etc.)</li>
<li>Intersections between Wallace’s work and the work of other authors (Kafka, Dostoevsky, etc).</li>
<li>The role of freedom in Wallace’s work.</li>
<li>Connections between <em>Infinite Jest </em>and complexity theory.</li>
<li>The treatment of animals in Wallace’s work (cockatiels, lobsters, etc).</li>
<li>Wallace in the classroom. What does Wallace to others teach us about ourselves?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seminar Details and Submission Instructions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dates and Events: </strong>The seminar will take place from Thursday, June 22 – Saturday, June 24, 2022. Keynote: Professor Lee Konstantinou, Professor at University of Maryland, College Park.</p>

This is not an imposition of Greek thinking, but an integration and transformation of Greek thinking in a Jewish context. By understanding the breadth and depth of the entanglement of cultures, we can open up pathways and see growth and development in a tradition that was said to be closed off from abstract thinking and fractured from its surrounding culture. Professor Najman will argue that this was not the case. Rather, that Judaism, Hebrew, and the growth of new textual traditions continue to exhibit vitality and creative innovation throughout the Hellenistic period and beyond.</p><p>Hindy Najman is the Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture and the Director of the Oriel Centre for the Study of the Bible at the University of Oxford.She has written on the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rabbinic Literature and Pseudepigrapha.

			<title>[Tomorrow] Talk or similar: The Two Natures of Christ</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/105969</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Eleonore Stump (Saint Louis University)<br/><br/><p>Dear Colleague,<br/><br/>You are invited to participate in the next session of the Logic and Religion Webinar Series which will be held on <strong>December 15, 2022</strong>, at <strong>4pm CET</strong> with the topic:</p>
<p><strong>THE TWO NATURES OF CHRIST</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: <u>Eleonore Stump</u> (Saint Louis University, USA)</p>
<p><strong>Chair</strong>: <u>Michal Pawlowski</u> (University of Warsaw, Poland)</p>
<p>Please register in advance!<br/>https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars</p>
<p>Abstract: The doctrine of the Incarnation is central to Christianity but it seems self-inconsistent in virtue of attributing contradictory properties to one and the same thing. I explore the notion of reduplicative propositions and the concept of borrowed properties to examine this puzzle, and I argue on this basis that the doctrine is coherent.</p>
<p>Join us 5 minutes prior to the beginning of the session!<br/> <br/>With best wishes,</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>Francisco de Assis Mariano <br/>The University of Missouri-Columbia<br/>LARA Secretary<br/>lara@logicandreligion.com</p></description>

			<title>[ February 21, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Shaikh al-Ishraq and the Modern World</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/105874</link>
						<description><p>The Institute of Suhrawardi’s Wisdom and the Academy of Sciences of Iran in collaboration with some academic centers organizes an international conference to reread the thoughts of Shaikh al-Ishraq. Rereading Suhrawardi's thoughts is of great importance for the new generation who live in a different world from Suhrawardi's time. There is no need to say that in this rereading, due to the critical nature of the modern world, there may be some criticisms of those ideas. This international conference, which will be held in person and online in March 2023, originates from the view that original premodern intellectual traditions can be the source of insight and inspiration for the contemporary human being in solving his/her complicated problems.</p>

			<title>[ January 5, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Respiratory Philosophy: A Paradigm Shift in Philosophy</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/105826</link>
						<description><p>Breathing is a rare theme in philosophy, and it is only in recent years that philosophy of breathing as a new way of doing philosophy has begun to interest some thinkers.

			<title>[ June 18, 2023 -  June 21, 2023] Conference or similar: Respiratory Philosophy: A Paradigm Shift in Philosophy</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/105822</link>
						<description>Venue: Grand Hotel Bernardin<br/><br/><p>Breathing is a rare theme in philosophy, and it is only in recent years that philosophy of breathing as a new way of doing philosophy has begun to interest some thinkers. The pioneers of the field are Luce Irigaray (1983), David Kleinberg-Levin (1984) and Peter Sloterdijk (1998). It was only in the 2010s that explicit and systematic studies have been published on the philosophy of breathing.</p>
<p>The respiratory philosophy as presented and articulated at this conference deals with our relationships with the atmospheres of breathing and air. “Breath” might seem like a peculiar project, or at the very least disconnected from the way in which most European philosophy has understood itself and its goals. But the “forgetting of air and breathing” (Irigaray) in European philosophical discourse is by itself one of the deepest, unacknowledged tensions, shaping its unfortunate outlook on the world. A new respiratory philosophy has the double merit of decolonizing the philosophical curriculum through an inclusion of non-European sources and insights, and of revealing how such “breathing” is a fundamental (even if erased) element of its own history. The potential of such a paradigm shift bears far-reaching consequences for the areas of ontology, ethics, poetics, politics, environment, spirituality, and health – as fields being in the forefront of this new respiratory paradigm.</p>
<p>The conference topics include and contributions are invited to address:</p>
<p>➢  Historical roots and intercultural aspects of air and breathing</p>
<p>➢  Forgotten Pre-Socratic philosophical thinking: pneuma, aer, psyche, thymos, phrenes</p>

<p>➢  Prāṇa and breathing in Indian philosophies and religious systems</p>
<p>➢  Qi/ki in East Asian philosophies, bio-medicine, religious systems and martial arts</p>
<p>➢  Japanese aesthetics of atmospheres, sky, wind and breathing</p>
<p>➢  Main modern Japanese respiratory philosophers and practitioners: Okada, Fujita, Nakamura, Kato, Ogawa, Yamaguchi, Kuriyama</p>
<p>➢  Western respiratory and aerial poets and poetics of breathing: Shakespeare, Goethe, Hölderlin, Coleridge, Shelley, Rilke, Mörike, Claudel, Celan</p>
<p>➢  Respiratory and aerial ontology</p>
<p>➢  Respiratory and aerial ethics</p>
<p>➢  Atmospheric art</p>
<p>➢  Breathing as an embodied experience for aesthetic performance (dance, music, film, theatre, calligraphy)</p>
<p>➢  Cross-cultural respiratory philosophy and aesthetics</p>
<p>➢  Breath and olfactory philosophy</p>
<p>➢  “I can't breathe” and critical theory of race</p>
<p>➢  Respiratory democracy and breathing as a force of social justice</p>
<p>➢  Gender, disability, and queering breath</p>
<p>➢  Atmopolitics, bad air and environmental philosophy</p>
<p>➢  Breathing and breathlessness in a post-COVID world</p>

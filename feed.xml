			<title>[ April 19, 2024 -  April 20, 2024] Conference or similar: Reapproaching Walter Benjamin: The Task of Theory Today</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/117045</link>
						<description>Venue: 1151 Richmond Street<br/><br/><p>We are pleased to announce the in-person 2024 Annual Theory Conference, hosted by The Centre for the Study of Theory &amp; Criticism at Western University from <strong>Friday, 19 April – Saturday, 20 April 2024.</strong> </p>
<p>The historian capable of fanning the spark of hope, for Walter Benjamin, is a historical materialist. Distinguishing between Materialist historiography and historicism, Benjamin praises the former, as it ruptures the continuity of history and dares to redeem both past and future. If historicism is in the service of the victor, the task of the historical materialist is to uncover forgotten traditions of the oppressed. However, this work is not simply remembering the past; it is critically reconstructing and arranging the given in the "Jetztzeit," thus creating and producing meanings and, finally, newly experiencing. In this context, Benjamin unfolds his theory from the position of a historian, a philosopher, a critic, a creator, or none of the above. With these thoughts in mind and many more, this graduate conference re-visits Benjamin, re-approaching his legacy through the vexed questions of contemporary theory. <em>Namely, what is the task of theorists today?</em> How has theory changed under late capitalism since Benjamin's own critiques? Do Benjamin's writings (or those inspired by him) offer ways to overcome the atomization and alienation of the neoliberal subject? In a nutshell, what is the applicability of Benjamin for a new generation of theory?</p>
<p>Benjamin offers a historically situated form of critique that produces experience as a “multiplicity of knowledges” to critically address our present. In keeping with the task to engage our present moment from a multiplicity of knowledges, we invite papers and presentations, regardless of discipline, that engage Benjamin and contemporary theory.</p>
<p>The Annual Theory Conference endeavours to cultivate a forum for diverse engagement from graduate students and scholars with a broad range of backgrounds and approaches. This year we are seeking work that contributes to Benjamin's heritage and participates in critical debate across philosophy, politics, media, arts, literature and all other relevant disciplines. </p>

			<title>[ November 21, 2023] Talk or similar: L’institution selon Merleau-Ponty : intersubjectivité, désir, politique</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/117009</link>
						<description>Venue: 2910 Édouard-Montpetit<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Emmanuel Alloa (Université de Fribourg, Yale University)<br/><br/><p>La notion d’institution que Maurice Merleau-Ponty développe dans le cadre de ses cours au Collège de France vers le milieu des années 1950 représente l’un des concepts les plus originaux de la pensée de Merleau-Ponty, dont la recherche n’a pas fini d’épuiser toutes les potentialités. Présenté comme « remède aux difficultés de la philosophie de la conscience », la nouvelle philosophie de l’institution vise à penser les événements par lesquels le sens émerge, se cristallise et se perpétue. Dans le sillage du concept de « Stiftung » de Husserl, auquel il emprunte et qu’il déplace à la fois, l’institution selon Merleau-Ponty renouvelle la phénoménologie du temps, pour l’entraîner du côté de l’histoire et de la vie symbolique. Non content d’offrir un nouveau cadre à la philosophie transcendantale, la notion d’institution ouvre également la phénoménologie aux enjeux du langage, de l’histoire de l’art, de l’histoire culturelle et de la pensée politique</p></description>

<p>Conceptions and representations of the witch and witchcraft have intersected with experiences, beliefs, and projections concerning sexuality and the erotic throughout the development of the witch-figure and its antecedents.   This panel is open to papers exploring any aspect of this relationship, ranging from sexual and erotic aspects in mythic and popular representations (in any media) of the witch and witchcraft (and historical traditions that gave rise to them), associated antinomian, demonic and diabolical projections of witchcraft and witches (including sexual and erotic elements in the projections themselves) and related or secondarily and/or reciprocally inspired practices, sexual and erotic themes or motifs in intercultural projections and constructions of the witch-figure, and the role of sexuality and the erotic in traditional and neo-traditional witchcraft identities, beliefs, and practices, as well as their representations in cultural media.  Papers from any scholarly perspective and/or disciplinary approach will be considered, including papers addressing the role and/or representation of the witch or witchcraft beliefs and practices in sexual or erotic context in non-witchcraft traditions, as well papers addressing the influence of these elements of witchcraft traditions, beliefs, and practices on other traditions, in the context of sexuality and erotic experience.</p>
<p>If you would like to propose a paper to be presented in this special panel, or you would like more information about the requirements or the conference Area, please contact Dr. George Sieg, the Area Chair for Esotericism, Occultism, and Magic, directly at <a href="mailto:georgejsieg@gmail.com">georgejsieg@gmail.com</a></p>

<p><strong>"The Esoteric Turn as Methodological Reform in Art History"</strong></p>
<p>It is generally accepted that esotericism and occultism were pervasive strains in the production of modern Western art. However, art historical methodologies are often reductive and inadequate to the study of exceptional human experience. In the midst of an esoteric turn in the mainstream artworld, and surging interest in esotericism, occultism, and magic throughout media and popular culture, the forms of standardization embedded in disciplinary art history are in need of reform. This special panel invites presentations that seek to explore the necessity of disciplinary inclusion and methodological pluralism, and how such approaches can embody new ways of knowing and thinking, new epistemologies. Can we think of new ways of making sense of the background and interpretive context of artistic works? How might methods from seemingly disparate disciplines, humanities and the sciences, enhance an understanding of modern art with esoteric, occult, and magical themes? Can we articulate what’s missing from standard, conventional methods and propose new solutions? We invite artists, art historians, critics, and scholars to explore these questions and others as we engage the ongoing limitations in disciplinary art history in favor of more imaginative grounding.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: Deleuze and Guattari Studies Special Issue "Space, Control, Resistance"<br/><br/><p><strong>Guest Editors: </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Milica Mađanović</p>
<p>Simona Žikić</p>
<p>George Hristov</p>
<p>The collection is dedicated to the theme of the <em>15th International Deleuze and Guattari Studies Conference and Camp</em>: ‘Space, Control, Resistance’.</p>
<p>The conference reengaged with Deleuze’s ‘Postscript on the Societies of Control’, in which he named ‘control’ as the ‘new monster’, and outlined a new arrangement of power in which ‘liberating and enslaving forces confront one another’ in a novel way.</p>
<p>The old societies of discipline, which Deleuze saw as the predecessor to those of control, operated through spaces of confinement and enclosure. Their crisis gave way to a different type of spatial organization of power: instead of discreet enclosures, we find ourselves in open spaces and within a continuous network. The enclosed and isolated body of the prison has given way to bodies in ‘open prisons’ and a nomadic psyche that carries the panopticon with(in) itself. However, these novel spaces of domination call for ‘new forms of resistance’, and also, new types of critique. By employing Deleuze and Guattari's conceptual framework, this special issue aims to explore the intersection of liberation and enslavement within these spaces and chart new paths for theory and critique.</p>
<p>We invite contributions from both those who presented at the conference and those who did not but wish to contribute to the issue. Papers that engage in conceptual and theoretical analysis, and arguments that seek to apply Deleuze and Guattari’s conceptual framework to specific fields, are equally welcome. The range of topics may include (but is certainly not limited to) the following:</p>
<p>-         Becoming of the concept of ‘control’ in Deleuze and Guattari’s thought</p>
<p>-         Comparison of Deleuze’s outline of control society and new ‘immanent critique’ to contemporaneous developments in other traditions (for example, Honneth’s redeployment of ‘immanent critique’ in recognition theory)</p>
<p>-         ‘Resistance’, ‘discipline’ and ‘control’ in Foucault, and Deleuze and Guattari</p>
<p>-         Digitalization and AI as new spaces of control and resistance</p>
<p>-         Control society and migration</p>
<p>-         Spaces of control, built environment and public infrastructure</p>
<p>-         Anthropocene studies and ecology</p>
<p>-         ‘Control’ and literature</p>
<p>-         Spaces of control, and visual and performing arts</p>
<p>-         Control and Marxism (transition to control as an evolution of capitalism)</p>
<p>-         The role of time and temporality in thinking new forms of resistance</p>
<p>Authors are kindly asked to send abstracts before submitting their complete manuscripts to ensure alignment with the issue’s themes. Please send your abstracts to the email address provided below by <strong>January 10, 2024</strong>. The abstracts should be between 250–400 words in length. Authors will receive notification of acceptance or rejection by January 31, 2024. It is important to note that approval of abstracts does not guarantee acceptance of final manuscripts.</p>
<p>The final contributions should be in the range of 6000–8000 words and adhere to the <em>Deleuze and Guattari Studies</em> style, which can be found at [<a href="https://www.euppublishing.com/loi/dlgs">https://www.euppublishing.com/loi/dlgs</a>]. The deadline for the first drafts of papers is <strong>July 1, 2024</strong>.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: Special Issue: Critical Phenomenology of the We<br/><br/><p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://puncta.journals.villanova.edu/"><em>Puncta. </em>Journal of Critical Phenomenology</a></p>
<p><strong>Special Issue: “Critical Phenomenology of the We”</strong></p>
<p><strong>-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>Phenomenology offers not only incisive analyses of intentionality, experience, selfhood, empathy and interpersonal understanding, but also quite sophisticated investigations of collective intentionality, affective sharing, social participation, communal experience, and group-identity. Indeed, while starting out with an interest in the individual mind, phenomenologists began exploring dyadic forms of interpersonal relations shortly before the start of World War I, and were deeply engaged in extensive analyses of communal forms of intentionality during the interwar period – at a time when nationalism was on the rise. Today, the "We" has not lost its place in philosophical, political, or popular discourse. Within the last decade, phenomenologists have shown how phenomenology can contribute to the “discovery of the We” (Szanto &amp; Moran 2016). These explorations have rediscovered lesser known early phenomenological writings on sociality by Gerda Walther, Edith Stein, Max Scheler or Aaron Gurwitsch and highlighted their relevance for contemporary problems in social cognition theory and analytic social ontology. Phenomenological approaches to sociality, we-experiences, and community, however, too-often concern themselves with ideal social ontological entities rather than the non-ideal social reality we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>A critical phenomenology of the We explores new lines of questioning at the intersection of phenomenology of sociality and critical phenomenology, putting pressure on the allegedly neutral and unpolitical nature of the recent phenomenological discovery of the We. This special issue serves the purpose of demonstrating how critical perspectives both on and within phenomenological analyses can be enriching for philosophical discussions of the We and sociality more broadly. Taking critical phenomenology as the guiding methodology, we foreground the constitutive significance that lived experiences of marginalisation, exclusion, social identity, conflict, ambiguity, and asymmetry have on experiencing ourselves as part of a We. How does the recent critical turn in phenomenology support, extend, qualify, or challenge phenomenological analyses of sociality? How can phenomenological descriptions of social phenomena point out pathways for social and political transformation and change? A critical phenomenology of the We investigates the question of “who are we?” as socially situated, historically contextualised, and culturally specific subjects.</p>
<p>We encourage original submissions on the theme Critical Phenomenology of the We which critically engage with themes found within both classical and contemporary phenomenological discussions of the We. We particularly encourage submissions that speak to one (or more) of the following lines of inquiry:</p>
<p>(1) For one, we are looking for contributions that take a clear starting point in lived experiences and real-life cases. Possible themes for such inquiries are, but not limited to, the ways in which group identity informs, obscures, and motivates acts of discrimination, normalisation, and oppression; how feelings of belonging and community are manufactured for exploitative ends, the role of collective memory and collective imagination for marginalised and historically oppressed groups; how narratives are collectively constructed to both hide and bring to light past and present injustices and their complex temporality.</p>
<p>(2) We also welcome papers that critically engage with classical and contemporary debates on the 'we'. How might we challenge and contest the valuing of community over society we find in Husserl, Walther, and Stein? How has the paradigm of European culture shaped the debate and how might we look beyond it? Do phenomenological analyses of second person engagement overlook the constitutive significance of the third person?</p>
<p>(3) Finally, we are interested in contributions that show the relevance of analyses from early 20th century phenomenology for contemporary debates within the philosophy of sociality. Besides the likes of Merleau-Ponty, Fanon, Beauvoir, and Sartre, how can the likes of Edith Stein, Gerda Walther, Max Scheler, and Aron Gurwitsch enrich recent more political engagements with the phenomenological method? In what sense can the  homeworld/alienworld distinction in Husserl’s generative phenomenology help us make sense of concrete intergroup dynamics?</p>
<p>With these themes in mind, a (non-exhaustive) list of possible topics to be examined under a phenomenological lens is:</p>
<p>·        The We of political movements, protest, and resistance</p>
<p>·        Group, collective and social identities</p>
<p>·        Group antagonisms and modes of domination</p>
<p>·        Inter- and intragroup relations of solidarity and care</p>
<p>·        The role of the 'Them' or the 'Third in the constitution of the 'We'</p>
<p>·        Asymmetrical reciprocity, empathy, and language breakdowns</p>
<p>·        Critiques of the relation between familiarity and strangeness</p>
<p>·        Feelings of (non-)belonging</p>
<p>·        Collective imagination and memory</p>
<p>·        Shared narratives of political, cultural, and transgenerational communities</p>
<p>·        National and transnational identities in classical and contemporary phenomenology</p>
<p>·        Questioning the We of philosophy and academia</p>

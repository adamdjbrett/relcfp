						<description>Publication Name: CALL FOR PAPERS / APPEL A PROPOSITIONS :  Etudes Ricoeuriennes / Ricoeur Studies (ERRS)  / Volume 15, N°1 (2024) :  « Ontology and Metaphysics in Ricoeur’s Philosophy »<br/><br/><p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS / APPEL A PROPOSITIONS :</strong></p>
<p><strong>Etudes Ricoeuriennes / Ricoeur Studies (ERRS)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Volume 15, N°1 (2024</strong><strong>) :</strong></p>
<p><strong>« </strong><strong>Ontology and Metaphysics in Ricoeur’s Philosophy </strong><strong>»</strong></p>
<p>Ontology and metaphysics are fields of inquiry and disciplines that have structured philosophy since its origins, and have undergone countless developments to the present day. They represent the most general and abstract aims of thinking about being qua being, of systematic knowledge of beings, and of what determines the way in which other fields of philosophical investigation can be elaborated. In the twentieth century, the contributions of phenomenology and analytic philosophy transformed definitions inherited from the tradition, leading to ontology becoming the most general framework for investigating being or, alternatively, to differentiating metaphysics and ontology by ascribing specific regions of being and objects to them according to related analytic or descriptive aims. Whether as a teacher and historian of philosophy or while producing his own work, Ricoeur came back to this diverse heritage. While his approach was derived from the Kantian critique of metaphysics as ontotheology, it has also become more complex by determining itself in relation to a general framework irreducible solely to either the legacy of Kantianism or the post-metaphysical perspectives that result. Here, then, the concern of reformulating ontology based on the phenomenological method or the scientific paradigm is decisive: Ricoeur explicitly sought to maintain the reference to a metaphysical plane and to the legitimacy of this reference as part of his philosophy of human action and hermeneutics of the self.</p>
<p>However, this position needs to be reconsidered in the light of Heidegger’s ontology and post-Heideggerian reformulations of ontology, of a post-metaphysical perspective more specifically derived from a Hegelian lineage, and of an analytic philosophy that affirms anew the connection between ontology and metaphysics as well as their respective purposes. While Heidegger’s idea of destruction of metaphysics and its various legacies rely on a fundamental ontology that precedes all epistemology and ethics, Ricoeur’s philosophy highlights the need to return to the epistemological and ethical plane from the ontological one: here, a well-maintained bond with metaphysics is at play. With regards to a post-metaphysical stance claimed by the critical theory in a Hegelian vein, the relation of Ricoeur’s anthropology to objective spirit, through its self-proclaimed metaphysical connection to human action, necessarily deserves consideration. The way that Ricoeur seeks to escape this reference to a post-metaphysical framework might instead relate to approaches and elaborations stemming from analytic philosophy: hence one finds references to problems in ontology and metaphysics alongside references to analysis in philosophy of language and philosophy of mind. While this reappropriation receives hardly any acknowledgement, and is even strongly criticized, it nonetheless results from the way in which Ricoeur deals with the ties between ontology and metaphysics and then builds up an approach of his own that differentiates itself from usual legacies within the phenomenological vein.</p>
<p>Some of Ricoeur’s work refers to those different legacies, to a greater or lesser degree, while another part continuously develops a hermeneutics of the self from this original affirmation using ontological and metaphysical reflection that claims roots in French reflexive philosophy, phenomenology, and hermeneutics. Although mainly approached within the vein of phenomenology and in the wake of Heidegger’s philosophical provocations, Ricoeur nevertheless defines ontology and metaphysics as the ultimate, always problematic, and unfinished goal of philosophical discourse. But this seemingly unresolved difficulty within Ricoeur’s philosophy, a result of its Kantian and Heideggerian legacy, would be compensated for by the fact that the issue of human action is precisely linked to a metaphysical aim that necessarily relies on Ricoeur’s own conception of ontology. One must thus consider not only the link between metaphysics and morality or ethics, but also the decision to hold metaphysics and ontology together in a way that, after a confrontation with Levinas’s philosophy, explains its difference with the latter and specifies the framework of its hermeneutics of the self with regards to the meta-category of alterity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, issues of ontology and metaphysics can be considered from these approaches. The first approach relates to legacies of the history of philosophy and the multiple ways in which variations of thought on being qua being construct and attempt to deal with the polysemy of being. The second one relates to Ricoeur’s more personal engagement with various philosophical, theoretical, and even theological currents of his time, linking the issue of human action to issues of identity, ipseity and alterity. These two approaches – one that looks at the history of philosophy as a whole, another that tries to elaborate a more personal path – inevitably overlapped at one point or another, bringing to light the most salient leanings of Ricoeur’s approach to ontology and metaphysics. In this respect, <em>Oneself as Another</em><em> </em>represents a kind of peak achievement, as it brings together the various contemporary resources of Ricoeur’s thought and philosophy of human action as anticipated since its inception. It is nevertheless noteworthy that, in <em>Réflexion faite</em>, he looks back in a partly critical way at this last section of <em>Oneself as Another</em>, leaving the final reading of the ontology and metaphysics throughout his work open. <em>The Course of Recognition</em> refers again to this project of generating metaphysics anew, by deepening the questions of human action and attestation by starting out from the recognized-being.</p>
<p>This issue of ERRS aims to gather articles that explore these links between legacies of the history of philosophy and the reappropriations or reformulations that characterize Ricoeur’s philosophy specifically</p>
<p>-- by reviewing the significance of Ricoeur’s references to French reflexive philosophy (Marcel, Nabert etc.), his initial approach to human action and the issue of evil, or the phenomenological, ethical and metaphysical issues involved in his relationship with Levinas’s philosophy;</p>
<p>-- by focusing on Ricoeur’s project for a philosophical anthropology linked to an ontology of action and power, engaging in an in-depth reading of Aristotle or even referring to Spinoza, but from the perspective of a critique of substantialism;</p>
<p>-- by confronting Ricoeur’s ontology and metaphysics with the methodological and epistemological discussion inherited from hermeneutics, phenomenology and analytic philosophy, notably in regard to significant developments within the latter vein; or, more polemically, with regard to post-metaphysical perspectives;</p>
<p>-- connections with the fields of theology and the philosophy of religion can also be taken into account, but preferably as far as they shed light on what Ricoeur tries to implement from a philosophical field considered for its own sake;</p>
<p>-- any study that relates Ricoeur to a theme or author dealing with metaphysics or ontology is welcome.</p>

			<title>[ October 5, 2023] Talk or similar: Online Talk in Italian by Professor Piergiorgio Donatelli on Democracy and Climate Crisis</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/114874</link>
						<description>Venue: Lungadige Porta Vittoria, 41<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Piergiorgio Donatelli (Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza)<br/><br/><p>On <strong>5 October 2023</strong> at the University of Verona (Italy) <strong>at 16.00 CET,</strong> Professor Piergiorgio Donatelli (Sapienza University of Rome) will give a talk in Italian entitled "Il lato ordinario dell'ambiente".</p>
<p>  <strong>Abstract:</strong> La crisi climatica e l’accelerazione tecnologica delle società ispirano atteggiamenti discordanti che si uniscono nell’incoraggiare lo scetticismo riguardo alla possibilità di apportare un cambiamento. Da un lato, c’è la tendenza a idealizzare la natura come un’entità incontaminata, incompatibile con il progresso tecnologico e sociale, mentre, dall’altro lato, la crisi è vista come una sfida globale che si pone al di là delle possibilità umane di affrontarla. In entrambi i casi, si coltiva la sfiducia nelle capacità cooperative e democratiche. Possiamo invece puntare su una diversa abitazione negli ambienti, esplorando nuove grammatiche della natura, dove insediare il progetto democratico.</p></description>

<p><strong>Series Editor: Heather Ostman</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Palgrave Studies in Global Literatures and Religion Series invites book proposals for essay collections or monographs that align with the Series’ intention:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Palgrave Macmillan Global Literatures and Religions series foregrounds literary uses of religion (doctrine, ritual, historical, cultural, metaphoric/symbolic), as well as its extensions (such as mysticism, religious orders, and other further-reaching possibilities) as frameworks, points of access, or expressions of divinityin narratives or poetry. This series focuses on literature, drawn from around the world, produced during the periods between the sixteenth century to the present, when the major world religions were experiencing tectonic shifts in their demographics and their societal roles in modern life. Grounded in literary study and theory, the series offers studies that explore the ways literature has imagined and reimagined the role of religion, as well as divinity. As such the series prioritizes a dialogic approach to the study of literature and religion, with a careful and thoughtful eye toward studies that reflect and expand what “religion,” means, as a dynamic, ever-changing feature of cultures, spanning multiple centuries.</p>
<p>Importantly, the scope of this series broadly includes the perspectives of diverse global religions, as it offers readers insights into this field from a rich multiplicity of texts, representative of a fuller picture of the present literary landscape. The series focuses on literature familiar to current students, scholars, and readers, in addition to lesser-known narratives and poetry, as they too bring greater depth to the ways literature and religion intersect and create greater understandings of the human condition.</p>
<p>Taking this broad approach, the Global Literature and Religion series offers volumes that emphasize the quest for meaning and the search for divinity within the theological, cultural, political, and/or social transitions of the last 450 years.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Songlines and Lifelines: Women and Muslim Vernacular Cultures on the Malabar Coast  </p>
<p dir="ltr">Muslim vernacular cultures on the Malabar Coast have recently attracted international critical attention from researchers working at the intersections of the humanities and social sciences (Muneer 2016, 2022a, 2022b, 2023; Gamliel 2017; Arafath 2018, 2020; Ottathingal 2020;  Sutton 2022; Weinrich 2022; Ul-Ihthisam and Menon 2022—to cite a representative few).  These researchers, who mainly focus on the Arabi Malayalam literary culture of the  Mappilas, offer incisive insights into this literary culture—historically and contemporaneously— in ways that are especially remarkable for their interdisciplinary methodological gambits. However, women’s wide-ranging role in the Muslim vernacular cultures of the Malabar Coast is conspicuous by its absence in this otherwise intriguing and significant scholarship, which started appearing on the scene in the mid-2010s (Cf. Sherin  2021, a notable exception that proves the rule). This proposed edited volume of essays, to be submitted to the Routledge Asian Studies book series, seeks to bridge the research gaps in  Malabari Muslim literary and cultural studies by spotlighting women and their multi-faceted contributions.  </p>
<p dir="ltr">Archival records dating back to the eighteenth century unravel the role of Muslim women in the production, consumption, and dissemination of oral-literary texts in vernacular Arabi  Malayalam script in the coastal Malabar belt of South India. Women’s role in fashioning and sustaining “Mappila literary formation” (Muneer 2015) can hardly be overemphasized,  although such a role must largely be retrieved from the edges, margins, and shadows of texts,  sounds, and histories, as it were. Similarly, the genre of song-poetry, pastiching the Persian Arabic style and Indo-Jewish traditions, was co-opted by women to compose marriage songs,  elegies, war songs, and songs of love and sensuality since the early nineteenth century.  Equally significant is the engagement of women with vernacular Arabi Malayalam magazines, and the essay and pamphleteering cultures of the Malabar Coast. While thinking through the literary formations of Muslim women in Malabar, the volume seeks to conceptualize the vernacular literary and cultural spaces of South Asian Malabari Muslim women complicating the European genealogies of print culture, of Western binaries of the private/public, sacred/profane and resistance/submission, among other things.  </p>
<p dir="ltr">In tandem with other vernacular cultures of South Asia, the Arabi Malayalam compositions by women simultaneously embrace the orality and written, with the aural, visual, and embodied performatives producing the oral-written texts and vice versa. Drawing extensively from the scholarship on vernacular literary cultures of South Asia, this volume is interested in chronicling literary communities/performative cultures that are embedded in the aural, visual,  emotive, and multisensorial spaces of Malabari women. The volume will also explore the entanglements of the domestic, social, and sacred intimate spaces of women with literary practices and performance cultures, formulating a breakaway from conventional feminist geography, and spatial studies on gender which has often relied upon a privileging of the public over the private, of the literary over the verbal, and so on. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The scope of the volume includes, but is not limited to:  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Women and the formation(s) vernacular/Arabi Malayalam literary culture  (historical/archival/performative reconstructions/interventions in historical  anthropology) </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Malabari women, “multilingual locals” and “significant geographies” (Laachir,  Marzagora, and Orsini 2018) </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Arabi Malayalam literary cultures of Muslim women – poetry, novels, fiction, semi-fiction, travelogues, essays, newspaper culture, ethics literature, and didactic  pamphlets  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Oral-performative traditions – Oral vernacular poetry and Performative communities  among Muslim women  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Women writing love, desire, and sexuality  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Memoirs, short biographies, and autobiographies in Arabi Malayalam  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Storytelling communities, Reading Groups, Literary Production, and Publication in  Arabi Malayalam  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Space and Vernacular Cultures – The politics and poetics of spaces, Shrinescapes,  Madrasah spaces, Intimate religious communities, and the Domestic  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Malabari women's sociality and “care aesthetics” (Thompson 2023)  • Food Cultures – Recipes, and Kitchen Communities  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Disease, Pandemic, and Disasters  </p>
<p dir="ltr">• Women writing across the Indian Ocean – Travelling texts and vernacular cultures  across Malabar  </p>

<p dir="ltr">Call for Papers:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Competing Christian Identities</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Much of what is at the heart of the contemporary crisis within Christianity might best be understood as the trouble of competing identities. Certainly, the most visible conflicts surround issues of gender and sexuality.  For example, apologists for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine have sought to justify the war, at least in part, by arguing that contemporary Western liberalism, particularly as it relates to sexual and gender identity, is incompatible with a Slavic and/or Orthodox identity.  Consequently, this rhetoric has both been produced by and exacerbated existing divisions within the Orthodox world. Similarly, the 2022 Lambeth Conference was defined by the boiling over of deep disagreements within the Anglican communion regarding sexuality and gender, which were expressed in stronger terms than ever before. </p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Far from being limited to the politics of gender and sexuality, Christian identities are shaped and complicated in a plethora of diverse ways to significant consequence. Aside from inter-ecclesial issues, ecumenical relations between churches reconsider identity and pose questions relating to purity and pollution vis a vis the religious other. For some, Christians the negotiation of religious-cultural memory between diasporic communities and 'homebound' ones is fraught with challenges and may result in a personal hierarchy of identities to be negotiated, expressed or hidden in particular circumstances. Moreover, the impact of competing identities on the Church and individual Christians is not limited to our contemporary moment, but instead has been a continuous feature of Christian history. Thus this conference seeks to explore competing, contested identities within the Christian Churches both historically and in the contemporary moment as a way of better understanding how various narratives of self and community act to influence Christian theology and practice in a variety of contexts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Paper Presentations:</p>
<p dir="ltr">We invite abstracts (of no more than 500 words) for paper presentations of 20 minutes from scholars, students, clergy, and laity addressing any aspect of the role of competing identities, broadly defined, in the shaping of Christian theology or practice from any tradition or time period for inclusion in a conference tentatively entitled Competing Christian Identities,to be held inCambridge in the Summer of 2024.  We are particularly eager for papers which bring different periods and/or traditions into dialogue with each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Roundtable Presentations:</p>
<p dir="ltr">We invite abstracts of no more than 500 words for short papers to be circulated before our event and presented by the author in a roundtable format. With an eye to the context of our venue, round table presentations should focus specifically on issues related to Orthodox-Anglican dialogue, broadly defined.  Presentation of these papers is designed to provoke conversation among presenters and participants. The presentation of the pre-circulated paper is limited to four minutes and may serve either as a restatement of the paper, a response to another paper or a further exploration of  related themes  to the pre-circulated paper. Roundtable papers respond to the prompts found below. </p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Roundtable topics include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Issues of identity in Orthodox-Anglican Dialogue in 20th-century America</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gender and Sexuality in Orthodox-Anglican Dialogue</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Meaning of  Ecumenical Dialogue for a “National” Church</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Please submit abstracts by 30 November 2023 to <a>identityandreligion@gmail.com</a> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Those wishing to discuss their contribution in advance of submitting an abstract are welcome to contact Fr. David-John Williams at <a>dwilliams@usk.edu</a> or  Dr. Katherine Kelaidis at <a>kkelaidis@hellenicmuseum.org</a>.</p>

With groundbreaking work such as Yashica Dutt’s <em>Coming Out as Dalit </em>(2019), Divya Cherian’s <em>Merchants of Virtue: Hindus, Muslims, and Untouchables in Eighteenth-Century South Asia </em>(2022) and so on, Caste has become, rightly so, an avoidable part of the global-postcolonial-neocolonial world of scholarship. Recent work by scholars like Nico Slate and Isabel Wilkerson seeks to compare and connect modern racial structures in the US and Europe to the ancient system of Caste in India. Nico Slate, similar to Wilkerson, bases his work on the coinciding decline of slavery and the expansion of the Empire in the nineteenth century, to trace connections between India’s twentieth century anti-colonial struggle and American struggle against racial segregation. Moving away from the assumption that the study of Caste has to be limited to the Dalit studies, this panel seeks to bring to attention the caste-ridden relations, structures, institutions and individual identities that seem to remain “caste-less”. The goal of this panel is to think about possibilities of further expansions in the study of Caste as a critical analytic that reveals structures, connections and points of flux. Further, this panel also seeks to direct critical attention to the uptake of Caste in academia. Participants are encouraged to submit proposals that address but are not limited to the following ideas:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Affordances of a cross-disciplinary intersectional study of Caste</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><strong>Writing Faith and Place in Early Modern Britain</strong></p>
<p align="center">17th–19th April, University of Exeter</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>This conference will explore literary and religious cultures across the regions of early-modern Britain, the counties and provincial centres, outside of London from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. We are interested in the writing of places, of local communities, and in particular of religious identities. Several key writers of the period are strongly associated with certain localities (e.g. Philip Sidney and Mary Sidney Herbert in Wiltshire, Thomas Browne in Norwich, Robert Herrick in Devon, Lucy Hutchinson in Nottinghamshire, Henry Vaughan in Brecknockshire, John Bunyan in Bedford, William Cowper and John Newton in Olney). A far wider range of lesser-known and sometimes anonymous writers, from a range of social classes, spent writing lives outside of London; their writings imagine their place in local spaces and communities. Faith forms a central theme of much of this work: religion not only motivated the most common and best-preserved records of provincial literary culture, but was also central to shaping community life in the centuries following the Reformation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Literature of the early-modern localities includes sermons and spiritual autobiographies, but more besides: poetry, pamphlets, journalism, philosophical treatises, manuscript notebooks, and letters. We are interested in how such texts fashion a sense of locality, how they project ideas of community and readership, and how they evoke the shared spaces, networks, histories, and religious values of their neighbourhood. We are also interested in how such texts participate in national controversies at a local level, how they situate their community within the period’s reformations and revolutions, and how this included participating in conflict. And we are keen to trace the networks of patronage, preaching, and publishing that connected local literary production with the capital.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Papers may focus on a broad region, or a single community; may provide a local angle on one key figure; or may trace a nationwide issue through several local case studies. They may include literary analysis, theological or religious study, bibliography, or social or local history, and more. General enquiries and expressions of interest are welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our interests emerge from the Leverhulme-funded project ReConEx (“Writing Religious Conflict and Community in Exeter, 1500-1750”), which has shed new light on the breadth and vibrancy of writing produced in Exeter and Devon throughout the early-modern period. This has captured the rival community-forming and conflicts between different strands of Anglican conformity and Puritan Dissent throughout the period, but also the region’s contacts with London and with the outside world, including encounters with Islam and Judaism. We are increasingly convinced, however, that this case study needs to be placed in both a regional context, tracing Exeter’s cultural links across the southwest, but also a national context, comparing analogous activities in localities across the country. While the conference will include some focus on Exeter and the southwest, we are keen to receive proposals for case studies on all regions outside of London, with the aim of encouraging cross-comparison across a breadth of contexts. Keynote addresses will be given by Prof. Mark Stoyle (University of Southampton) and Dr Alison Searle (University of Leeds).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please send a short biography (ca. 100 words) along with a title and brief abstract (250 words) for a 20-minute paper, or for a panel (3 x 20-minute papers) to <a href="mailto:d.parry@exeter.ac.uk">d.parry@exeter.ac.uk</a> by <strong>12th January 2024</strong>. An edited collection of selected papers from the conference is envisaged for publication.</p>

			<title>[ October 14, 2023] Conference or similar: The Orientation of Reason: Léon Brunschvicg on Philosophy, Mathematics, and the Sciences</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/114766</link>
						<description>Venue: University of Bristol<br/><br/><p><strong>The Orientation of Reason: Léon Brunschvicg on Philosophy, Mathematics and the Sciences</strong></p>
<p>Léon Brunschvicg (1869-1944) was, alongside Henri Bergson, the central figure in Francophone philosophy at the turn of the 20th century. His work represents a shift from the Spiritualist and Positivist philosophical heritage of the 19th century to a historicised neo-Kantianism that laid the foundations for both historical epistemology and other tendencies within the distinctive brand of French philosophy of science. He developed his philosophy through the reinterpretation of early modern thinkers (especially Descartes, Pascal, Spinoza, and Kant), and philosophical reflection on the scientific revolutions that took place between the end of the 19th and the early 20th century. The impact of Brunschvicg’s legacy cannot be overstated, as an entire generation of thinkers had to define themselves in relation to his work. He supervised the doctoral theses of J. Cavaillès, A. Lautman, G. Bachelard, and R. Aron, whereas M. Merleau-Ponty, J. -P. Sartre, and S. De Beauvoir, who were also his students, partly developed their own philosophies in opposition to his “intellectualism”. Institutionally, he was a crucial figure (along with X. Léon, E. Halévy, A. Lalande, L. Couturat, and others), in the foundation of both the <em>Revue de métaphysique et de morale</em> and the <em>Sociéte française de philosophie</em>, central organs for the formation of French philosophy in the 20th century. Further, his project is a methodological precursor to contemporary work in France in the philosophy of science—and in particular in the philosophy of mathematics.</p>
<p>This workshop gathers researchers to promote the historical and philosophical research on Brunschvicg’s work, as well as broader investigation into this period of French philosophy and into the French tradition in the philosophy and history of the sciences.</p>
<p>This workshop is possible due to the funding of the British Society for the History of Philosophy and the Brigstow Institute Ideas Exchange project.</p>

It focuses on African engagements with Islam at these different scales and how such engagements help to shape imagination of the past, present, and future. Such cultural and political imagination can have important implications for African Muslims’ writing of history, their modes of belonging, shifting affiliations, and aspirations for the future. To date, there has been considerable scholarship on how various ethnolinguistic groups (e.g., Swahili) and areas (e.g., the Indian Ocean) in Africa in which Islam and Islamic religious culture feature prominently have been implicated in regional, transregional, and global entanglements across space and time. There is also growing scholarship on Asia-Africa and Middle East-Africa, as well as on shifting geopolitics in a multipolar world. However, broader attempts to conceptualize such transregional and global entanglements beyond such case studies as they relate to Islam and Muslim societies have been rather limited. Given the broader objectives of analytical and comparative reflection about Islam in Africa in global context, presenters will cast new light on African engagements with Islam and some of the transregional and global connections African Muslims have forged, as well as the implications such connections have for understanding Islam in a globalizing world. The panel invites papers dealing with African engagements with Islam at the intersection of the local, the transregional, and the global in various contexts across space and time using historical methods, ethnography, visual culture, and/or media studies.</span></span></p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><span><span><a name="_MailAutoSig"><span><span><span>Mara Leichtman</span></span></span></a></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Associate Professor<br/>Department of Anthropology<br/>Muslim Studies Program<br/>Michigan State University<br/>310 Baker Hall<br/>655 Auditorium Road<br/>East Lansing, MI  48824</span></span></span><br/><u><span><span><span><a href="mailto:maral@msu.edu">maral@msu.edu</a></span></span></span></u>  </span></span></p><p><span><span><a href="https://iupress.org/9780253016010/shii-cosmopolitanisms-in-africa/" rel="nofollow"><span><span><span>Shi'i Cosmopolitanisms in Africa: Lebanese Migration and Religious Conversion in Senegal</span></span></span></a></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:maral@msu.edu">maral@msu.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

Finding this a good occasion to re-visit Troeltsch’s work together with its broader context the Chair for Sociology of Religion at the Pedagogical University of Cracow would like to invite for the international conference <i>The (social) science of religion: Troeltsch, Weber, Simmel and others</i>. The main idea of the conference is to acknowledge and re-consider Troeltsch’s (rarely appreciated) role within the “visionary company” of great social scientists dealing with religion in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. What we attempt is broad and interdisciplinary reflection in which Troeltsch’s theological, philosophical and sociological approach together with the work of his contemporaries constitutes a point of departure. Submissions from sociologists, historians, theologians or philosophers are welcome. Different approaches to the main theme, both appreciative and critical, debates around heritage and questions of possible meanings that the “social science of religion” may have for (and in) our time – all this is of utmost interest to us. The list of possible topics includes:    </span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Troeltsch as a theologian and social scientist. Troeltsch has usually been treated as a theologian only while his contributions to social sciences or philosophy of religion have been overlooked or simply forgotten. But this is as much pigeonholing as treating Weber solely as a “classic of sociology”. In fact what both Troeltsch and Weber offer is a broad synthesis of theology, sociology, history and philosophy.     </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Troeltsch and his contemporaries – mutual inspirations and influences. Troeltsch has long been in the shadow of Weber and only recently was the importance of his work for social sciences and our reflection on modernity re-discovered. The same more or less can be said of Simmel.       </span></span></span></p><p><span><span> - </span></span><span><span><span>Troeltsch’s multidisciplinary “science of religion” among similar projects by Weber, Simmel Durkheim or James.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Visions of modernity and secularization in the writings of Troeltsch, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, Émile Durkheim or William James: parallels and differences.      </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Protestant Reformation in the writings of Troeltsch and Weber. The mutual influence of Troeltsch’s account of the birth of modernity out of the spirit of Protestantism and Weber’s theses about Reformation and capitalism is now indisputable. The question which may be asked today is which of these two accounts seem more relevant and inspiring from today’s perspective.  </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Mutual interactions between theology and social sciences in Troeltsch and other representatives of the “science of religion”.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Religion, historical consciousness and the question of values in Troeltsch and in the social science of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- The question of “public function” and political responsibilities of both social science and theology according to Troeltsch, Weber, Simmel or James. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The conference will be held on 1-2 June 2023</b><b> </b>at the Pedagogical University of Cracow in Cracow, Poland. The precise venue will be announced later.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>Abstracts of max. 300 words together with a short cv should be sent to: </span></span><span><span><b><a href="mailto:science.of.religion.conference@gmail.com">science.of.religion.conference@gmail.com</a>.</b></span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The deadline for abstracts is 28 February 2023</b><b>. </b>Authors will be notified of the acceptance of their submissions by <b>15 March 2023</b>.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>Conference languages are English and Polish.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b><u>Fee options:</u></b></span></span></p><p><span><span>1) 50 EUR – participation on-site </span></span></p><p><span><span>2) 80 EUR – participation + lunches on June 1 and 2</span></span></p><p><span><span>3) 100 EUR – participation + lunches + conference dinner on June 1</span></span></p><p><span><span>Abstract submitters are kindly asked to choose one of the options.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>All other costs, including transport and accommodation, should be covered separately by the participants.

			<title>[ June 22, 2023 -  June 24, 2023] Conference or similar: International David Foster Wallace Society 2023</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106009</link>
						<description>Venue: 300 N. Washington St.<br/><br/><p>DFW 23 Gettysburg</p>
<p><strong>International David Foster Wallace Society 2023</strong></p>
<p> “The Subject and Art” <strong>Call for Abstracts</strong> Gettysburg College <strong>June 22 – 24, 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conference Director: </strong>Vernon W. Cisney,</p>
<p>Chair and Associate Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies, Gettysburg College</p>
<p><strong>Keynote Speaker:</strong></p>
<p>Lee Konstantinou, Associate Professor of English, University of Maryland, College Park</p>
<p>Author of <em>The Last Samurai Reread</em> and <em>Cool Characters: Irony and American Fiction</em></p>
<p>The Gettysburg College Interdisciplinary Studies Department is delighted to announce the 2023 conference of the International David Foster Wallace Society, entitled “The Subject and Art.” Wallace famously considered his task as an author to be the exploration of what it means to be human. His work centers on fundamental, life-and-death questions having to do with intimacy, spirituality, and authenticity, as well as the darker existential dimensions of depression, loneliness, addiction, and death. He considered literature’s purpose to be the fostering of connections, opening spaces of intersubjectivity, and activating pathways of emotional affirmation. His writing is distinctively American, but it delves into aspects of life universal to the human experience. His body of work therefore provides a fecund field of inquiry for questions pertaining to the relations between subjectivity, intersubjectivity, and the arts.</p>
<p>The 2023 David Foster Wallace Conference will be held on the beautiful campus of Gettysburg College in historic Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, just one hour from Baltimore and ninety minutes from Washington, D.C. In the true spirit of the liberal arts, we invite submissions of abstracts from across the spectrum of academic disciplines.</p>
<p>Suggested questions and topics include, but are certainly not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What possibilities and limitations does language create for human connection? How does literature mitigate these limitations?</li>
<li>The role of masks and veils in Wallace’s work.</li>
<li>Different models of subjectivity in <em>Infinite Jest</em>.</li>
<li>Wallace as a critic of neoliberalism (<em>The Pale King</em>, for instance).</li>
<li>Wallace’s treatments of difference(s) (racial, sexual, socioeconomic, etc.)</li>
<li>Intersections between Wallace’s work and the work of other authors (Kafka, Dostoevsky, etc).</li>
<li>The role of freedom in Wallace’s work.</li>
<li>Connections between <em>Infinite Jest </em>and complexity theory.</li>
<li>The treatment of animals in Wallace’s work (cockatiels, lobsters, etc).</li>
<li>Wallace in the classroom. What does Wallace to others teach us about ourselves?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seminar Details and Submission Instructions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dates and Events: </strong>The seminar will take place from Thursday, June 22 – Saturday, June 24, 2022. Keynote: Professor Lee Konstantinou, Professor at University of Maryland, College Park.</p>

This is not an imposition of Greek thinking, but an integration and transformation of Greek thinking in a Jewish context. By understanding the breadth and depth of the entanglement of cultures, we can open up pathways and see growth and development in a tradition that was said to be closed off from abstract thinking and fractured from its surrounding culture. Professor Najman will argue that this was not the case. Rather, that Judaism, Hebrew, and the growth of new textual traditions continue to exhibit vitality and creative innovation throughout the Hellenistic period and beyond.</p><p>Hindy Najman is the Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture and the Director of the Oriel Centre for the Study of the Bible at the University of Oxford.She has written on the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rabbinic Literature and Pseudepigrapha.

<p><strong>THE TWO NATURES OF CHRIST</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: <u>Eleonore Stump</u> (Saint Louis University, USA)</p>
<p><strong>Chair</strong>: <u>Michal Pawlowski</u> (University of Warsaw, Poland)</p>
<p>Please register in advance!<br/>https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars</p>
<p>Abstract: The doctrine of the Incarnation is central to Christianity but it seems self-inconsistent in virtue of attributing contradictory properties to one and the same thing. I explore the notion of reduplicative propositions and the concept of borrowed properties to examine this puzzle, and I argue on this basis that the doctrine is coherent.</p>

						<description><p>The Institute of Suhrawardi’s Wisdom and the Academy of Sciences of Iran in collaboration with some academic centers organizes an international conference to reread the thoughts of Shaikh al-Ishraq.

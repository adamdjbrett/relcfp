			<title>[ July 15, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Experience and Non-Objects: Towards a Phenomenology of Indiscernibility</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/121286</link>
						<description><p>Exploratory workshop of the Society for the Phenomenology of Religious Experience</p>
<p>October 28-30, 2024, at the Simon Silverman Phenomenology Center, Duquesne University, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Confirmed Speakers: Michael Barber (St. Louis University), Michel Bitbol (CNRS, Paris), Peter Costello (Providence College), Neal DeRoo (Institute for Christian Studies, Canada), Crina Gschwandtner (Fordham University), Graham Harman (UCLA), Olga Louchakova-Schwartz (UC Davis), Martin Nitsche (Institute of Philosophy, Prague), Felix O’Murchadha (University of Galway)</p>
Experience and Non-Objects: Towards a Phenomenology of Indiscernibility
<p>For a long time, the objectlessness of religious experience has been a ground for denial of its existence. Yet, studies in phenomenology show these forms of experience exist, and are characterized by the intuition of the invisible. If such forms of experience are actual, the possibility of object-less perception and corresponding judgment can be extended toward experience in sciences. Specifically, this concerns the unobservable or indiscernible in quantum mechanics or quantum chemistry, or, to a lesser degree, the sciences of the brain.</p>
<p>In this invited workshop, we discuss relationships between the phenomenology of ordinary object-based everyday experience, and interesting, often religious, experiences which create a possibility for judgment (knowledge) of the invisible.  There are many accounts of the role of such experiences that can be drawn upon. For example,  under LSD, Carlo Rovelli had an experience that led him to formulate relational quantum mechanics. Another, dream experience of Mendeleev, provided an insight that led him to the development of the Periodical Table of Elements. Einstein is known to let his mind meander in the realm of imagination to crystallize his concepts. The recent Nobel Prize Winner, Anton Zielinger, stresses the role of imagination in quantum theorizing.  </p>
<p>True to Husserl’s view of metaphysics as the future task of phenomenology and drawing on both phenomenological and post-phenomenological perspectives and in dialogue with other contemporary philosophical approaches, the workshop will set out a perspective on how (to put it much too briefly) we can think the concept of reality containing both objects and non-objects, without reducing one to the other. Finally, we will also discuss how and if the concept of unified reality, which is theistic in its origin, participates in the object-less intuitions. </p>
<p>We still have space for submissions. The sphere of our interest rotates around the question of how and if the ego can “appresent” non-objects.  Disruptions of the everyday in meditation or the religious-spiritual practices of embodied inwardness (e.g., in Tantra,  Vedanta, the Prayer of the Heart, or other systems of religious experience) give us repetitive, predictable experiences, but what gives itself in these experiences?  And are these intuitions, presentations, or appresentations of the invisible? If there is a symmetry between the eidetics of embodied inwardness  and quantum concepts, what are conditions of possibility for this symmetry? Do the opposing arrows of time, multidimensionality of space, and other non-ordinary relationships, which manifest in these experiences, genuinely exist? Do such experiences encompass the notion of non-objects?  How can they be connected with eidetic intuition of quantum indiscernables (in a Leibnitzian sense)? What are the limits of mereology or logic in these analyses? “In the experience of embodied inwardness, how does the ego choose which aspect of passivity, the objects or non-objects, to bring into awareness? And ultimately: what is the sphere of validity for the theory of objects in confrontation with the invisible or indiscernible? We seek solutions from phenomenology of consciousness in its different forms: descriptive, eidetic, formal ontological, genetic, transcendental, or, lately, realistic, its mereology, topology, and apophansis, its provinces of meaning, in how they contribute to our conceptual picture of the world.</p>
<p>Around this broad spectrum of interconnected  themes, approximately ten talks will be accepted. Accepted talks and the rest of the submissions will be considered for publication in a topical issue of Frontiers. Selectively, we will provide support with applications for fee waivers. To be considered, please send a 300-word abstract to workshop2024@sophere.org. The mailbox is set for automated responses, so please check your spam folder if you do not receive a response. The deadline for submissions is June 15.  Acceptance notices will be sent out by August 15, 2024. We will accept original philosophical research reports,  hypotheses and theory, interpretive reviews, perspectives, case studies, reflections on method, and proposed research protocols.</p></description>

						<description><p>The Molloy University Philosophy Conference </p>
<p>featuring the North American Sartre Society</p>
<p>29th Annual Meeting</p>
<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>October 25-27, 2024</p>
<p>Molloy University</p>
<p>*This conference will be fully hybrid*</p>
<p>Submission Deadline: July 15th, 2024</p>
<p>Conference Themes:</p>
<p>Existential Medicine &amp; Existentialism and Disability</p>

<p>Jennifer Scuro</p>
<p>Jennifer Scuro received her Ph.D. in philosophy from the New School for Social Research. She has taught Philosophy and Ethics for over 25 years and is now an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Molloy University. Her research applies the Continental tradition, including the existentialist tradition, to issues related to critical disability studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and bioethics, with new research on the intersection of disability and trauma. </p>
<p>She is the author of Addressing Ableism: Philosophical Questions via Disability Studies (Lexington Books 2018) and The Pregnancy ≠ Childbearing Project: A Phenomenology of Miscarriage (Rowman &amp; Littlefield International 2017), the latter of which is a graphic novel narrative with a feminist philosophical analysis of pregnant embodiment and grief. </p>
<p>Her most recent publications include “The Postcolonial and the Post-Traumatic: Specters and Syndromes of White Feminist Canon” in the latest issue of philoSOPHIA: a Journal of trans Continental Feminism (Vol. 13, 2023) and the “Diagnosis” and “Trauma” entries for the collection, Keywords/Images in Graphic Medicine, (B.

			<title>[ June 4, 2024 -  June 5, 2024] Conference or similar: Forma e interpretazione. Prospettive estetiche ed ermeneutiche</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/121018</link>
						<description>Venue: Via Sant'Ottavio 20<br/><br/><p>Il problema della forma è al centro degli interessi della filosofia sin dalle sue origini. La nozione di forma si sviluppa a partire da una serie di contrapposizioni - forma e materia, forma e contenuto, forma e sostanza - e intreccia la sua storia con numerosi altri vocaboli fondamentali del lessico filosofico: la forma è a seconda dei casi «essenza», «schema», «categoria», «figura», e assume la funzione di ciò che unifica il molteplice, dello sfondo universale che costituisce il terreno comune per accomunare gli elementi particolari, ma anche della struttura permanente che sopravvive alle modificazioni della materia.</p>
<p>V'è una prima nozione di forma, e di formale, sviluppata in particolare da Kant, che indica la dimensione che precede ogni esperienza e ogni contenuto particolare, ed è quindi propriamente universale; è solo su questo terreno che può svolgersi la matematica, con la sua pretesa di validità universale. L’universale formale ha anche una struttura relazionale: esso nasce con una presa di distanza originaria dall’esperienza in generale, e si attua di volta in volta nelle prese di distanza concrete che realizziamo. Questa presa di distanza non annulla la concretezza: la sospende nella sua immediatezza, nella sua pressione vitale, e così le permette di trasporsi su questo nuovo piano in cui può coesistere con altri. Così l’universale formale sia nel suo originarsi che nel suo attuarsi resta in relazione con la concretezza. La riflessione su questa dimensione universale è resa particolarmente opportuna dalla condizione di pluralismo culturale che caratterizza il mondo di oggi.</p>
<p>Già nel pensiero antico il concetto di forma ha uno statuto molto complesso e variegato. La forma non è solo un'astrazione, ma è ciò che anima il vivente, ciò che vi è di più proprio al cuore di ogni cosa. La forma dell'oggetto è il suo destino, il suo fine, ciò che gli dà senso e che definisce le condizioni della sua possibilità, del suo nascere e del suo perire.</p>
<p>Tra il XVIII e il XIX secolo il pensiero moderno - in particolare tedesco - raccoglie con grande sensibilità questa ricchezza della nozione di forma, in quel momento cruciale che segna la nascita dell'estetica come noi la intendiamo ancora oggi, e dunque dell'idea moderna di arte, ma anche delle scienze naturali come la biologia, la botanica, la zoologia e l'antropologia. Il concetto di forma diventa la nozione che permette di tenere insieme natura e cultura, vita e tecnica, nascita e creazione.</p>
<p>In questo contesto la nozione di forma si fa plastica, dinamica: pensare il mondo significa pensare la vita delle forme, il loro mutare, svilupparsi, interagire nei meravigliosi quanto misteriosi processi della natura, come anche nelle idee degli artisti e degli artigiani. Le forme - naturali, artificiali, simboliche - hanno una storia: per questo esse vanno ricostruite, interpretate, mostrate nel contesto della loro genesi e del loro sviluppo. D'altra parte, l'interpretazione stessa si vincola alle forme su cui si applica: le forme strutturano i nostri modi di intendere, comprendere e agire, offrendosi come nello stesso tempo come condizione e posta in gioco dell'interpretazione. Mettendo in relazione forma e interpretazione, inoltre, quest'ultima si emancipa dal terreno linguistico e testuale alla quale in genere è ricondotta, aprendosi ad altri fondamentali ambiti della vita, quali la dimensione dell'immagine, della materia, della natura e della tecnica.</p>
<p>Il mondo contemporaneo è un dilagare di forme che si sovrappongono, si scontrano, entrano in relazione e si trasformano: in questo contesto così caotico, l'ermeneutica possiede gli strumenti per mostrare la pregnanza della dimensione formale, e produrre un'analisi critica che riguarda non solo i discorsi, ma anche gli oggetti, le pratiche, i saperi, le configurazioni simboliche della nostra epoca.</p>

<p>L’edizione 2023/2024 del seminario internazionale del Centro Studi Filosofico-religiosi “Luigi Pareyson” sarà dedicato dunque al rapporto tra forma e interpretazione. Al centro del dibattito, ovviamente, verrà posta la nozione di “formatività”, concetto centrale nel pensiero di Luigi Pareyson e dell’estetica del ‘900. </p></description>

<p><a name="_kryqh1e2ncq4"></a><strong>Form and Interpretation</strong></p>
<p><a name="_optza0alfb1d"></a>Aesthetic and Hermeneutic Perspectives</p>

<p><strong>University of Turin, 4-5 June 2024</strong></p>

<p>The problem of form has been central to the interests of philosophy since its origins. The notion of form developed from a series of oppositions - form and matter, form and content, form and substance - and intertwined its history with numerous other fundamental words in the philosophical lexicon: form is, depending on the case, "essence", "scheme", "category", "figure", and assumes the function of that which unifies the multiple, of the universal background that constitutes the common ground for uniting particular elements, but also of the permanent structure that survives the modifications of matter.</p>

<p>There is a first notion of form, and of formal, developed in particular by Kant, which indicates the dimension that precedes all experience and all particular content, and is therefore properly universal; it is only in this domain that mathematics, with its claim to universal validity, can take place. The formal universal also has a relational structure: it is born with an original taking of distance from experience in general, and is realised from time to time in the concrete taking of distance that we realise. This taking of distance does not erase concreteness: it suspends it in its immediacy, in its vital pressure, and thus allows it to transpose itself onto this new plane in which it can coexist with others. Thus the formal universal both in its origin and in its realisation remains in relation to concreteness. Reflection on this universal dimension is made particularly opportune by the condition of cultural pluralism that characterises today's world.</p>

<p>Already in ancient thought, the concept of form has a complex and varied status. Form is not just an abstraction, but is what animates the living, what is at the very heart of everything. The form of the object is its destiny, its end, what gives it meaning and defines the conditions of its possibility, its birth and its perishing.</p>

<p>Between the 18th and 19th centuries, modern thought - particularly German - took up this richness of the notion of form with great sensitivity, at that crucial moment that marked the birth of aesthetics as we still understand it today, and thus of the modern idea of art, but also of the natural sciences such as biology, botany, zoology and anthropology. The notion of form becomes the notion that holds nature and culture, life and technology, birth and creation together.</p>

<p>In this context, the notion of form becomes plastic, dynamic: thinking the world means thinking the life of forms, their changing, developing, interacting in the marvellous and mysterious processes of nature, as well as in the ideas of artists and craftsmen. Forms - natural, artificial, symbolic - have a history: that is why they must be reconstructed, interpreted, shown in the context of their genesis and development. On the other hand, interpretation itself is bound to the forms on which it is applied: forms structure our ways of understanding, comprehending and acting, offering themselves as both the condition and the stake of interpretation. By linking form and interpretation, moreover, the latter emancipates itself from the linguistic and textual domain to which it is generally led, opening up to other fundamental spheres of life, such as the dimension of image, matter, nature and technology.</p>

<p>The contemporary world is a deluge of forms that overlap, collide, relate and transform: in this chaotic context, hermeneutics possesses the tools to show the poignancy of the formal dimension, and to produce a critical analysis that concerns not only discourses, but also the objects, practices, knowledge, and symbolic configurations of our era.</p>

<p>The 2023/2024 edition of the international seminar of the "Luigi Pareyson" Centre for Philosophical-Religious Studies will therefore be dedicated to the relationship between form and interpretation. At the centre of the debate, of course, will be the notion of "formativity", a central concept in the thought of Luigi Pareyson and 20th century aesthetics. </p>

<p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>

<p>We welcome proposals concerning the following themes (or other related ones):</p>

<p>●      The problem of form, in historical or theoretical terms.</p>
<p>●      The relationship between aesthetics and hermeneutics.</p>
<p>●      The theme of formativity in Luigi Pareyson and in the tradition linked to him.</p>
<p>●      The relationship between aesthetics and practical philosophy. </p>
<p>●      The problem of form in relation to contemporary media and technologies. </p>

<p>Travel and accommodation expenses will be covered for the candidates.</p>

<p>Applications must be sent by email to<strong> pareyson@unito.it</strong> by <strong>April 7th 2024</strong>. The email must include as an attachment:</p>

<p>●      An academic CV.</p>
<p>●      An abstract (max. 500 words) including title.</p>

<p>Contributions in <strong>Italian </strong>and <strong>English </strong>are accepted.</p></description>

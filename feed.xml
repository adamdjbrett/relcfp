			<title>[ September 24, 2024 -  September 25, 2024] Conference or similar: Christian Philosophy facing Naturalism</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120478</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The dispute between naturalism and anti-naturalism has been underway almost since the very beginnings of philosophy. Christian thinkers, by proclaiming that God as Creator transcends the reality He has created, and that human beings as persons transcend the material world, have entered this dispute on the anti-naturalist side. The contemporary dominance in culture of the naturalistic paradigm requires Christian philosophy to reflect on naturalism in the broadest sense (in its various forms), together with its conditions and consequences, and to rethink its relationship to this philosophical tradition. Naturalism rejects the possibility of something existing, being known, or being explained that is separate from the material reality given in empirical cognition. Along with this, it denies human beings transcendence with respect to the natural or social world. In its contemporary iteration, this tradition appeals to the solutions and methods of domain-specific forms of scientific inquiry, relying on them for its own authority.</p>
<p>For Christian philosophy, naturalism represents a powerful challenge. It is possible to see in it a threat to Christian philosophy, but it is also possible to discern in it an opportunity for a more critical evaluation of Christian philosophy’s previous solutions, and an opportunity to develop new ones. There is a need for a better understanding of naturalism itself, as well as of what the various domain-specific sciences (including the natural and social sciences, as well as the humanities and, currently, neuroscientific research in particular) have to say about the world and about human beings. Systematic and historico-philosophical questions equally still call for debate—in relation to the centuries-old dispute between naturalism and anti-naturalism, as well as the changing place of Christian thought within it. In our own time, one can witness diverse attempts by Christian thinkers both to critically discuss naturalistic positions and to implement naturalistic approaches or solutions within Christian thought itself. Certainly, the latter cannot ignore the fact that naturalism allows philosophy to maintain cognitive contact with domain specific forms of scientific inquiry.</p></description>

			<title>[ May 30, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: &quot;The Dynamics of Secularism, (Anti)Clericalism, Theology, and Science in Southeastern and Central Europe&quot;</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120490</link>
						<description><p>The Institute for Advanced Studies of the University of Montenegro invites you to participate in the international conference <strong>“The Dynamics of Secularism, (Anti)Clericalism, Theology, and Science in Southeastern and Central Europe”</strong>. The conference is organised as part of the project “Beyond the Anticlerical Paradigm: Rethinking Secularism in Contemporary Montenegro” supported by the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>Recent socio-political developments in Montenegro, marked by the active role played by the Orthodox Church during the country’s tumultuous period of political changes (2020-2023), invite us to theorise the evolving conceptions of secularism, secularity, post-secularism and (de)secularisation in Montenegro’s political and cultural context, as well as reflect on how these trends play out in the broader regional setting of Southeastern and Central Europe. To this end, our conference seeks to explore contemporary theoretical perspectives on the contentious interplay between secularism, pluralism and post-secularism, with a particular interest in how these debates pertain to the unique historical experiences and contexts of Southeastern and Central Europe, as well as on Montenegro’s idiosyncratic case.</p>
<p>We hope to engage with a variety of themes pertaining to the role of religious organisations in the public sphere, the place of religious argumentation in public discourse, and the historical legacies that informed the diverse secular configurations in Southeastern and Central Europe.</p>
<p>This conference will be held on <strong>September 28-29, 2024</strong>, in the coastal town of <strong>Petrovac, Montenegro</strong>.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of suggested topics of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophical and theological dimensions of the relationship between religious organisations and the State, and historical influences on this dynamics – from the legacy of Byzantine <em>symphonia</em> to the Imperial eras of the 18th and 19th centuries and the 20th-century experience of communism;</li>
<li>The notions of secularism, pluralism, and the post-secular public sphere in the thought of Charles Taylor, Jürgen Habermas, William Connoly and other relevant contemporary thinkers;</li>
<li>The relationship between secularisation as a historical process, secularity as an epistemic category, and secularism as a political doctrine beyond the West, with emphasis on modern and contemporary historical experiences in Southeastern and Central Europe;</li>
<li>The nexus between religion, nationalism, state and nation-building, and the contemporary role of religious organisations in the discursive articulation of dominant national identities and imaginaries in Southeastern and Central Europe;</li>
<li>The political activism of religious organisations, and their role in the processes of post-communist transitions of Southeastern and Central European states; narratives of clericalization, de-secularisation and anti-clerical resistance in the discourse of political actors in Southeastern and Central Europe;</li>
<li>Contemporary perspectives on the academic and disciplinary status of theology and divinity studies, secularist and post-secularist conceptions of religious education and its place in the primary, secondary and higher education curricula in Southeastern and Central Europe;</li>
<li>Contemporary perspectives on the place of religious discourse and religiously inspired justification in the public sphere, and the compatibility and interrelation of theological and scientific viewpoints in Southeastern and Central Europe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submission Guidelines: We invite scholars and researchers to submit abstracts that offer fresh insights and critical reflections on these themes. Proposals can encompass a range of disciplines, including political science, history, sociology, law, anthropology, theology, and philosophy. </p>
<p>Please submit an abstract of no more than 300 words, including a provisional title, 3-5 keywords, along with your full name and academic post/affiliation (if any). Selected papers will also be considered for publication in the conference proceedings.</p>
<p>Important Dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract Submission Deadline: <strong>May 30, 2024</strong></li>
<li>Notification of Acceptance: <strong>June 30, 2024</strong></li>
<li>Conference Dates: <strong>September 28 &amp; 29, 2024</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Keynote speakers will include Hugh McLeod (University of Birmingham), Marco Ventura (University of Siena) and Saul Newman (Goldsmiths, University of London).</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your abstracts and to the vibrant discussions that will undoubtedly emerge from this critical examination of secularism, (anti)clericalism, theology, and science in the context of Southeastern and Central Europe.</p>

			<title>[ September 9, 2024 -  September 13, 2024] Conference or similar: XII. International Congress of the German Society of Aesthetics – The Media of Art/The Arts of Media</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120510</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>So-called 'media art' has been around not only since technical media began to intervene in the art world; there has never been media-free art. There is no art that does not express itself in certain media, be it image, sound, light, space or language. There is no art that does not rely on marble and chisel, colour and canvas, pen and paper, sound waves and screen, bits and bytes. Neither media nor materials are ever external to a work of art; rather, aesthetic meaning only arises through the respective medial-material configuration and would be invalid without it. The XII. Congress of the German Society for Aesthetics will focus on the question of the media of the arts: Can the arts be understood differently or better if we look at them in the light of their media? What distinguishes the arts from one another? Does each art genre have its own medium? What does media specificity mean in the tradition, from Lessing to Greenberg, and what does it mean today, in the age of artistic "entanglement" [<em>Verfransung</em>] (Adorno) and of multiple hybrid forms? Modernist attempts to return art to its pure, illusion-free medium stand in contrast to more recent developments in which intermediality, cross-over and transmedial practices set new standards. Despite all the invocations of a 'post-medial condition', the classic question remains impellent: to what role material qualities play in form-shaping processes and to what extent the different contexts of manifestation influence the circulation of signs.</p>
<p>All DGÄ members are invited to submit proposals on this topic, whether from a historical or contemporary, systematic or applied perspective. Some topics will be the 'obstinacy' of iconic, choreographic, cinematic or architectural artefacts, to name but a few, about the analogue/digital difference, the media prerequisites in the mass production and reproduction of art and about the function of media in dissemination, commentary and archiving, right up to their use in the artistic creative processes themselves, for example in the context of AI-generated art. It will be discussed what consequences this has for classic aesthetic concepts such as originality, authorship or creativity - does AI art even exist and if so, how can it be specified? - to the exorbitant ecological footprint of supposedly dematerialised phenomena such as NFT and crypto art.</p>
<p>In this respect, the focus of the congress is not only on the media in the arts, but also - in a kind of reverse entanglement - on the function of the arts in context of media. If it is true that aesthetic objects, situations and events make it particularly easy to understand that form and content, medium and message cannot be separated from each other, what insights does this provide for media processes in general? What does it mean for the prevailing transparency paradigm of mediality when works increasingly discover the sensual-aesthetic potential of media that no longer make themselves transparent in favour of what is depicted? Do not other, previously unseen sides become recognisable precisely in the design features? If all art is to be regarded as media art in this sense, then it must do so insofar as it works with media in a reflexive and critical way and shows how they work. Art without media is empty, that much is beyond question, but conversely, can it also be said that media without art is blind? The congress provides an opportunity to debate the relevance of aesthetic thinking for mass media societies.</p>
<p>We welcome contributions on the topic of "Media of the Arts / Arts of the Media" from all areas of theoretical and practical aesthetics, from the perspective of individual arts as well as from media studies and art sociology, from artistic research, art education and inter- and transcultural aesthetics.</p></description>

			<title>[ November 4, 2024 -  November 5, 2024] Conference or similar: Cruelty and Brutalism Today</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120458</link>
						<description>Venue: Dobra 72<br/><br/><p>Papers and panels are invited for the interdisciplinary conference, <strong>“Cruelty and Brutalism Today”</strong>, which will take place in Warsaw from 4-5 November 2024. The conference is organized by the Faculty of “Artes Liberales ” at the University of Warsaw (Poland) and is part of the “Technology and Socialization” project.</p>
<p>Cruelty has many faces. Indeed, the cruelty of war is incomparable to the silent cruelty taking place in the privacy of our homes, and this is different from the cruelty of “cold institutions” that often use the letter of the law. However, what is disturbing is the scale of cruelty and the laughter of torturers acting not only without a sense of guilt but also with a dubious justification for the “greater necessity” of using violence.</p>
<p>In his book <em>Coldness and Cruelty</em>, Gilles Deleuze asks questions about contemporary forms of sadism and masochism. We want to reflect on the forms of the “sadistic Superego” utterly devoted to cruelty, but also the forms of the “masochistic Ego” ready for “affective contact”. The affective constellation of our world gives the impression that we are already operating outside Hegel’s dialectic of recognition, which is the dialectic of recognizing the desire of the Other. Contemporary politics has become devoid of mediation, armed with naked violence that can only escalate.</p>
<p>Andrew Culp claims that our era is not the “age of sad passions but of the masochistic contract that is sealed by fusing the cruel thrill of exploiting others with the self-destructive delights of being oppressed.” This masochistic contract is accompanied by widespread de-medialization, which – as it seems – ends the era of representation. Everyone wants to be present today and present their opinion without the help of a mediator. The representation gives way before the presentation. Does this state of affairs always end with a shitstorm of media that allows immediate release and which becomes – as Byung-Chul Han writes – a kind of “communication reflux” that destroys not only the order of power but also the very possibility of expressing respect. The screen is no longer a window to the world or even a frame but an information board on which data, images, inscriptions and texts move. Today, the screen is a frame for affectation and a seat of indifference. This is a severe problem.</p>
<p>During the conference, we will try to diagnose the sources and forms of atrocities in a world increasingly devoid of intimacy and sensitivity and increasingly filled with brutalism. As Achille Mbembe rightly argues, Brutalism today “is not an architectural style or a type of leading aesthetics, but the very essence of politics”. We argue that this brutalism goes deeper, i.e., the principles of operation of our affects, the libidinal economy. The tools of brutalism are cold (calculated) and hot (expressive) cruelty. Deleuze, citing Roberto Rossellini, concludes that art today is either lament or cruelty. Rossellini himself suggested that cruelty always consists of the violation of someone’s personality, forcing someone to be entirely and unreasonably exposed. Isn’t this the type of total exposure we see daily on our computer screens? We may live in an era of chaos, but does it justify the appeal to “pure factuality” and the policy of “final resorts”, in which the militarization of the police and the politicization of the army have turned our lives into a state of constant occupation?</p>
<p>Presentations are expected to be between 20 and 30 minutes. Please send abstracts of up to 300 words, attached in a Word document, with a short bio to <strong>technologyandsocialization@gmail.com </strong>by the 31st of August, 2024. Should you need any further information, do not hesitate to contact us at the same e-mail address. All information about the conference and the “Technology and Socialization” project can be found here. We are looking forward to your participation and to hosting you in Warsaw.</p></description>

It can also suggest the opposite: something in a state of change can be said to be in “the middle”—neither one thing nor another. Mythcon 53, located in the middle of the continental U.S., welcomes papers exploring the concept of “middle-ness” as it is worked out in fantasy, science fiction, and related genres. Paper topics can cover a wide range of possibilities, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>• Locations: This could mean the implications of a place name including the word “middle,” such as Middle-earth or Midgard; places in our world that either shape or appear in fantasy such as the English Midlands or Middle America as in Stranger Things or American Gods; or even liminal places that appear in fantasy such as train stations, purgatory, or The Wood Between the Worlds.</p>
<p>• Characters: the middle child in a family (Arya Stark, Edmund Pevensie); adolescents negotiating that in-between space (Luce in The Owl House; Ged in Earthsea); individuals or people groups who are a mix of others (Tolkien’s Númenóreans; Percy Jackson)</p>
<p>• Textual middle-ness: intertextuality, genre-crossing, multiple media, even the middle books/movies of a trilogy (The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers)</p>
<p>• Authors: considering the location of the con, Midwestern authors and scholars such as Tim O’Brian, Jack Zipes, Lois McMaster Bujold, or Philip Jose Farmer.</p>
<p>We also welcome papers on the work of either of our Guests of Honor, Brian Attebery and Eleanor Arnason. Because this conference is happening in conjunction with Diversicon, a multicultural, multimedia event dedicated to improving contacts among groups and individuals interested in speculative fiction, we are also interested in papers on their traditional Posthumous Guest, who this year is L. Frank Baum. And, as always, we welcome papers focusing on the work and interests of the Inklings (especially J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Charles Williams), and other fantasy authors and themes. Papers from a variety of critical perspectives and disciplines are welcome. Each paper will be given a one-hour slot to allow time for questions, but individual papers should be timed for oral presentation in 40 minutes maximum. Panels are also welcome, and both papers and panels may be presented virtually or in person. Participants are encouraged to submit papers chosen for presentation at the conference to Mythlore, the refereed journal of the Mythopoeic Society. Paper abstracts of no more than 300 words, along with contact information, should be sent to the Papers Coordinator at <a href="mailto:papers@mythcon.org">papers@mythcon.org</a> by May 15, 2024. Please include your A/V requirements and the projected time needed for your presentation. If your programming interests are more in line with Diversicon’s focus (see <a href="http://www.diversicon.org/">http://www.diversicon.org/</a>), then please send your proposal to <a href="mailto:scottl2605@aol.com">scottl2605@aol.com</a> .</p>

			<title>[ September 5, 2024 -  September 6, 2024] Conference or similar: The Existential Dimension of Doubt</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120374</link>
						<description>Venue: Avenue Campus<br/><br/><p><strong>‘The Existential Dimension of Doubt’ - Launch Conference of the ERC Advanced grant project ‘The Ethics of Doubt – Kierkegaard, Scepticism and Conspiracy Theory’, September 5-6, 2024, University of Southampton, UK</strong></p>
<p>While the ancient sceptics regarded scepticism about knowledge as a way of life, philosophers from Descartes to the present day have viewed it primarily as an intellectual problem that requires only a theoretical solution. The aim of this conference is to challenge this contention by focussing on the ‘existential’ dimension of doubt – i.e. the way in which sceptical problems affect the whole person. For example, Danish philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard, has proposed that doubt and anxiety are intrinsically linked, and, hence, that doubt may not just be an epistemic vice (if it is one), but also a character failing that consists in a refusal to confront (and to try and overcome) certain forms of <em>angst</em>, such as, for instance, a refusal to face up to the radical contingency and fragility of the (human) world and to take refuge in a ‘scapegoating’ scenario, where super-powerful, hidden agents are to blame: Descartes’ Evil Demon, on the one hand, or, say, a ‘Deep State’ controlling our actions, on the other. The conference aims to explore these issues from a number of different philosophical perspectives (both Kierkegaardian and non-Kierkegaardian) and to bring together Kierkegaard scholars and epistemologists, working in both theoretical and applied areas of the subject.</p>
<p>Confirmed speakers include: Anita Avramides (Oxford), Yuval Avnur (Scripps), Lucy Campbell (Warwick), Annalisa Coliva (UCI), Jim Conant (Chicago),<br/>Rick Furtak (Colorado), Stephen Mulhall (Oxford), Marilyn Piety (Drexel), Duncan Pritchard (UCI), Mark A. Tietjen (Stony Brook).</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending, please contact my post-doc, Dr. Taylor Matthews (T.Matthews@soton.ac.uk).</p></description>

						<description>Publication Name: "Occultism and Politics in Central and Eastern Europe"<br/><br/><p>"<strong>The Polish Journal of the Arts and Culture. New Series</strong>" invites scholars to submit their articles to a special issue "<strong>Occultism and Politics in Central and Eastern Europe</strong>".</p>
<p>Since the nineteenth century, Central and Eastern Europe has experienced rapid social, political, and economic changes, which caused transformation and upheavals in local societies. Rising nationalism culminating in the Revolutionary year 1848, echoes of the Romantic movement, ongoing industrialisation, First World War, the emergence of national states and disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, later followed by World War Two and the establishment of the socialist regimes represent some of the key milestones the region went through. New sciences emerged, and intellectuals of the region also tried to cope with the impetus of new discoveries in the Orient. Since mid-nineteenth century, the rise of occultism and its further spread throughout Europe represented a peculiar reaction to these conditions. Central and Eastern European states dealt with these occult and esoteric movements in various ways, from suppression to silent support, and the movements themselves had various ideas about the meaning and aims of the nation. We wish to investigate the links between state, power, and occult and esoteric ideas, movements, and key figures.</p>
<p>Focusing on occultism and esotericism in Central and Eastern Europe since the mid-nineteenth-century until now, we invite scholars to share their articles in a special issue of "The Polish Journal of the Arts and Culture". The scope of the issue includes the following topics:<br/>- Tensions between or calls for nationalism and/or transnationalism in the occult and esoteric movements;<br/>- Attitudes of various state bodies (republics, empires or totalitarian regimes) to occultism and esotericism, from suppression to support;<br/>- Practising occultism or esotericism under socialist regimes;<br/>- Case studies of influential movements, persons, or ideas either originating or being adopted in Central and Eastern Europe;<br/>- Critical reflection of the scholarship concerning occultism and esotericism in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The guest editors of the issue are Dr. Karolina Maria Hess (Centre for Comparative Studies of Civilisations, Jagiellonian University) and Dr. Pavel Horák (Institute of Ethnology, Czech Academy of Sciences).</p>

						<description>Publication Name: "Society, Art, and Culture in the Face of War"<br/><br/><p>"<strong>The Polish Journal of the Arts and Culture. New Series</strong>" invites scholars to submit their articles to a special issue "<strong>Society, Art, and Culture in the Face of War</strong>". <br/><br/>From 24 February 2022, the eyes of not only Europe, but also the whole world, turned to Ukraine. The military operations that Russia had long conducted world-wide, and which escalated on that day in the eruption of the Russian-Ukrainian war, are a reminder of the armed, cultural and social conflict that has been growing in this region for years. The heroic Ukrainian mobilisation not only relates to the conduct of intense military operations but also to the self-organisation of society under the difficult circumstances of war. An essential element of this mobilisation is activity in the sphere of culture and art, focusing on the internal integration of Ukrainian society and acquiring external allies. <br/><br/>Focusing on the issues related to the cultural front, cultural policy, and cultural diplomacy during the Russo-Ukrainian war that has been ongoing since 2014, we invite scholars to share their articles in a special issue of The Polish Journal of The Arts and Culture. New Series. <br/><br/>Our goal is to examine the problems arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, genocide, war crimes, and international politics, especially from a philosophical and cultural perspective. The scope of the issue includes the following topics: <br/>- artistic and cultural opposition to war crimes (murals, performances, and others),<br/>- modern language of propaganda and communication (including the issue of hybrid war, social media, and the Internet),<br/>- cultural policy and cultural diplomacy in circumstances of war,<br/>- documentation and analysis of cultural crimes,<br/>- durability and objectivity of ethical values in the post-modern world,<br/>- post-memory as a tool for the categorisation and understanding of the present day,<br/>- development of intellectual culture and physical culture in new national/patriotic narratives. <br/><br/>We are also happy to announce that this issue opens academic cooperation between the Centre for Comparative Studies of Civilisations and the National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology in Lviv. <br/><br/>The editors of the special issue are Dr Elżbieta Olzacka, Dr Paulina Tendera (Krakow, Centre for Comparative Studies of Civilisations, Jagiellonian University), Taras Mazur MA (Lviv, National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology), and Dr Sergii Rusakov (Kyiv, National Pedagogical Drahomanov University). <br/><br/>The editors will consider all manuscripts prepared according to the following criteria: <br/>- Length: 30,000–40,000 characters with spaces.<br/>- Language: Polish and English<br/>- Deadline: March 2023 Please send your proposed contribution to: elzbieta.olzacka@uj.edu.pl &amp; paulina.tendera@uj.edu.pl<br/><br/>For further guidelines see: https://www.ejournals.eu/PJACNS/menu/574/</p></description>

			<title>[ October 7, 2022] Talk or similar: Conceptual Reverse-Engineering, Teleology and Concepts of God</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/102498</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Christos Kyriacou (University of Cyprus)<br/><br/><p>I argue that if there has been a divine creation act, then we can build on such a divine act to conceptually reverse-engineer the possible nature of God by (a) constructing possible models of the nature of God and by (b) comparing them for explanatory power (and other theoretical virtues). That is, I argue that, by analogy with human rational action, divine rational action must be constrained by certain requirements of practical rationality, such as: intentionality, voluntariness, purposefulness, instrumentality, responsibility, morality and providence. Of course, the analogy is loose and imperfect and should take into account the Anselmian proviso that, unlike feeble humans, God is a perfect being and fully rational, otherwise we will fall prey to crude anthropomorphism. Conceptual reverse-engineering of the nature of God must also be constrained by certain independently motivated metaphysical facts, such as the causal closure of the physical and the apparent necessity of the laws of nature. I then examine how different concepts of God (theism, deism, pantheism) fare with regard to the projected properties of divine rational agency and the metaphysical facts of causal closure and natural necessity. As it turns out, different concepts of God fare better with some aspects and worse with some others. Our task is to compare different models of the nature of God and search for the more explanatorily fruitful and overall more theoretically virtuous theory. </p></description>

<p>Baldwin’s work was never far from the language, thought, and practices of Black Christianity.  If, as some have said, Baldwin left the church, it is also true that the church never left Baldwin: its conceptions of love, truth-telling, confession, and mercy are never far from his epistemologies. Even Baldwin’s argument with Christianity is carried out through the identifiable rhythms, cadences, and rhetoric of what Josef Sorett calls “Afro-Protestantism.” Ultimately, Baldwin’s insistence on social justice and liberation is informed by a radical critique of structures of oppression and the workings of power, coupled with images of redemption such as “the welcome table.” As a religiously informed thinker and writer, Baldwin decries the violence of humanity while celebrating the sacredness of our human agency, bodies, and desires.</p>
<p>This special issue of <em>Christianity &amp; Literature</em> calls for submissions that examine Baldwin’s life and work in light of his lifelong engagement (and argument) with the principles and practices of the Christianity he inherited. Essays that take up any of the following issues are encouraged:  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Baldwin and Christianity now—esp. changes in Baldwin’s reputation over the past few decades</li>
<li>Baldwin as cultural icon: figure and symbol </li>
<li>Baldwin as public intellectual, activist, social historian, and cultural theorist</li>
<li>Genre criticism—Baldwin as essayist, novelist, playwright, etc.</li>
<li>Baldwin and antecedents—inquiry and imagination re: Black literary and theological traditions</li>
<li>Baldwin, sexuality (desires, acts, practices; histories, activism), constructions of gender, and religious experience or sacred traditions</li>
<li>Baldwin, Christian faith, and political action or accommodation </li>
<li>Baldwin, Christianity, and African American secularism or atheism</li>
<li>Baldwin, Critical Race Theory and the social construction of race</li>
<li>Baldwin and past and present political conflicts over teaching American history (e.g., The 1619 Project, chattel slavery, national identity)</li>
<li><em>I Am Not Your Negro</em> (2016 film, dir. Raoul Peck) </li>
<li>Any other issue re: Baldwin and Christianity</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Deadline: </strong> Abstract (300-500 words) due to Peter Powers (<a href="mailto:ppowers@messiah.edu">ppowers@messiah.edu</a>) by April 1, 2023.  Drafts of accepted essays (6000-9000 words) will be due August 1, 2023. All essays should be formatted according to the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition. </p>
<p> <strong>Inquiries: </strong> Direct inquiries about the issue to either Peter Powers (<a href="mailto:ppowers@messiah.edu">ppowers@messiah.edu</a>) or Jennifer McFarlane-Harris (<a href="mailto:mcfarlanehaj@spu.edu">mcfarlanehaj@spu.edu</a>).</p>
<p> <strong>Journal Editorial Statement</strong>: <em>Christianity &amp; Literature</em> is a scholarly journal devoted to the exploration of how literature engages Christian thought, experience, and practice. The journal presupposes no particular theological orientation but respects an orthodox understanding of Christianity as a historically defined religious faith. Contributions appropriate for submission should demonstrate a keen awareness of the author's own critical assumptions in addressing significant issues of literary history, interpretation, and theory. <em>Christianity &amp; Literature</em> is the official publication of the Conference on Christianity &amp; Literature (CCL).</p>

						<description><p><strong>South African Society for Critical Theory 4th Annual Conference</strong></p>
<p>17 – 19 November 2022</p>
<p>North-West University South Africa</p>
<p>https://www.facebook.com/groups/2185466648172350/</p>

<p><u><strong>Culture Industry 2.0: </strong><strong>Africa, Global South, World</strong></u><strong><br/><br/></strong></p>
<p> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p><em>The South African Society for Critical Theory is pleased to announce the keynote speakers for its forthcoming conference...</em><em></em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Keynote Speaker: Prof Samir Gandesha (Simon Fraser University)</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>Associate Professor in the Department of the Humanities and the Director of the Institute for the Humanities at Simon Fraser University, specializing in modern European thought and culture with a particular emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. He is co-editor with Lars Rensmann of <em>Arendt and Adorno: Political and Philosophical Investigations</em> (Stanford, 2012), and with Johan Hartle of <em>Spell of Capital: Reification and Spectacle</em> (University of Amsterdam Press, 2017) and <em>Aesthetic Marx</em> (Bloomsbury Press, 2017). In the Spring of 2017, he was the Liu Boming Visiting Scholar in Philosophy at the University of Nanjing and Visiting Lecturer at Suzhou University of Science and Technology in China. He also taught a course on the “Neo-Liberal Personality” in the Summer Semester at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil in February, 2019 and is a regular contributor to <em>openDemocrac</em>y.</p>

<p> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Next Gen Keynote Speaker: Kiasha Naidoo (University of the Western Cape)</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p><em>The Next Generation Keynote is intended as a means of supporting and developing future SA thought-leaders by offering early career academics the opportunity to deliver a keynote address.</em></p>

<p>Kiasha’s research concerns thinking neoliberalism as a governing rationality in the domain of means and ends. Moreover, to consider the way that such a rationality might bear on the human subject in terms of its ontology as fundamentally futural. She draws on the work of Michel Foucault and Wendy Brown in order to consider the functioning, limits, and high points of the exercise of power on subjects and collectivities with regard to life and death. Her research interest includes the effects of a neoliberal governmentality on our democratic ideals, notions of political collectivity, as well as on virtues and ends such as freedom, equality, and justice.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>The South African Society for Critical Theory (SASCT) invites abstract submissions of up to 500 words for its 4th Annual Conference which will take place at the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University, from the 17th to the 19th of November 2022. This will be a hybrid conference, with in-person attendance recommended but with accommodation made for online participation and presentations.</p>

<p>SASCT invites papers which address the concept of the culture industry, as described by Adorno and Horkheimer in <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment. </em>The culture industry sees forms of culture become part of the capitalist system of production which in the contemporary age has seen commodification spread from "culture" to all non-work activities of humanity - hobbies, sports, self-improvement, mental health, tourism, and so on. Of particular interest in this regard is the examination of the perils and potentialities of the imminent total colonisation of the life world, strategies of resistance, points of breakdown, as well as cultural and natural heritage as a public good or commodity – all questions that Critical Theory is geared to address.</p>

<p>As part of such considerations, this conference welcomes papers that consider the question of the culture industry in relation to Critical Theory, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>·         What might a critical analysis of the contemporary culture industry reveal?</p>
<p>·         What stance should Critical Theory adopt towards the culture industry in both its modern figurations, but also historically?</p>
<p>·         How does the culture industry figure into contemporary education?</p>
<p>·         Has the coronavirus outbreak affected the contemporary culture industry, and in what ways does nature’s otherness influence the culture industry?</p>
<p>·         How does migration factor into the culture industry of the world today?</p>
<p>·         Is ‘cancel culture’ a reaction to, or expression of, the Culture Industry?</p>
<p>·         How is the culture industry functioning in relation to postcoloniality, and what does an "African Culture Industry" entail?</p>

<p>The conference welcomes approaches from all aspects of Critical Theory, broadly construed. In particular, the conference welcomes papers that address issues relating to: African Critical Theory, Digital Culture, the intersections between Critical Theory of European origin (Frankfurt School, Foucault, etc.), Black Existentialism, and Africana Critical Theory as well as contributions <strong>on any and all</strong> aspects of Critical Theory, e.g. the 3 generations of Frankfurt School Critical Theory, Postcolonial Theory, De-colonial Theory, Critical Feminism, Critical Film Studies, Critical Race Theory, Critical Theory of Technology, Critical Legal Studies, Post-structuralism, Psychoanalysis, Critical Hermeneutics, Liberation Theory, Critical Pedagogy, Critical Theology, Critical Anthropology, etc. </p>

<p>The Conference organisers would also appreciate papers that address thinkers whose work lies outside the “canon” of Critical Theory, but whose work can extend current research in Critical Theory or whose work in itself embodies alternative forms of Critical Theory. Whilst the organisers encourage contributions that address the conference theme, the theme itself should be viewed as merely suggestive.</p>

			<title>[ January 27, 2023 -  January 28, 2023] Conference or similar: 1st Hegelian Society of Spirit Conference</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/102394</link>
						<description>Venue: Ltd 38/39 Fitzwilliam Square<br/><br/><p><strong>HEGEL AND HEGELIANISM TODAY</strong></p>
<p>In light of the resurgence of interest in the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel, the question of what remains at the core of Hegel’s philosophy has become increasingly pertinent. Taking this into consideration, we are also wondering how we are supposed to evaluate the Hegelian philosophy that has succeeded the initial impact of Hegel’s philosophy. This is a timely and unavoidable concern that Hegel scholars must face, one which reassembles the philosophical scene after Hegel’s death with the split between left-Hegelians, right-Hegelian, and young Hegelians all of whom misconstrued Hegel in some element or another. And since the history of Hegel scholarship until today has amounted to a bad game of telephone, we are wondering what makes contemporary Hegel scholarship and Hegelian philosophy different from this trend, if at all?</p>
<p>This conference seeks to explore two major concerns then: (1) when we look at Hegel’s work, what are we drawing from it as the core to his systematization of philosophy and how does it concern us today? And (2) in light of the proliferation of works on Hegel, how are we evaluating the value of these works as well as their relevance to Hegel’s philosophy? Therefore, this conference welcomes papers that focus on Hegel’s main texts the Phenomenology of Spirit and the Science of Logic, as well as other works by Hegel such as his early theological writings, The Philosophy of Right, the Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and others. We also welcome texts that enter into conversations with the interactions of Marxism and psychoanalysis with Hegel’s philosophy, as well as papers that address the work of authors such as Slavoj Zizek, Alenka Zupancic, Mladen Dolar, Alain Badiou, Adrian Johnston, Todd McGowan, Rebecca Comay, Frank Ruda, Susan Buck-Morss, Robert Brandom, Robert Pippin, Rocio Zambrano, and other contemporary Hegel scholars and commentators.</p>
<p><strong>Topics Suggested</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to be a Hegelian today?</li>
<li>Is Hegel dead? Or are we dead in the eyes of Hegel?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between the Phenomenology of Spirit and the Science of Logic?</li>
<li>What is a beginning in Hegel’s philosophy?</li>
<li>What is the end of Hegel’s philosophy?</li>
<li>What has changed in contemporary Hegelian scholarship from 20th century Hegelianism?</li>

<li>What is a Hegelian ethics? And how does it differ from other ethical orientations?</li>
<li>What is the role of religion in Hegel’s work from his early work to his more mature work starting with the Phenomenology of Spirit?</li>
<li>What is the Absolute for Hegel? And what is so radical about the Hegelian Absolute?</li>

<li>What is the impact of Reza Negarestani’s Intelligence and Spirit to Hegelian philosophy? Do its Pittsburgh Hegelian roots aid its project or ultimately hinder it?</li>
<li>With the development of new North American Hegelianisms in the work of Adrian Johnston, Rebecca Comay, and Todd McGowan, what do they captivate or fail to understand about Hegelian philosophy?</li>
<li>What is the impact of Pittsburgh Analytic Hegelianism (Sellars, McDowell, Pippin, Brandom)? And does it captivate or miss the heart of Hegel’s philosophy?</li>
<li>What is the impact of Slovene Lacanian Hegelianism (Zizek, Zupancic, Dolar)? And does it captivate or miss the heart of Hegel’s philosophy?</li>
<li>What are we to make out of the major differences between contemporary Hegelian schools? (For example, the Pittsburgh School and the Slovene School)</li>

<p>Tamil culture is very ancient. This is evidenced by the fact that over the years its impact has spread around the world. Temples play an important role in Tamil culture. Its antiquity, statues, architectural techniques, yoga and spiritual philosophies are not only surprising but also portraying the intelligence of the ancients and supernatural powers. The Tamil Siddhars have created, evinced and clarified the doctrine of temples. The temples are built as the signifier, the signified, and the outward appearance of body, mind and soul. The Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas (triumvirs), the Tamil kings, built thousands of temples and made great penances to the Gods for goodwill. There are millions of Shaiva and Vaishnava temples in Tamil Nadu and uncountable temples all over India. Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world. There are countless subsections in it. All the temples, from the great temples to the small temples, have a different central theme of spiritual doctrine and philosophy that is merged with life. Temples are considered as energy centers, chakras, and the replica of the human body itself. The purpose of this peer-reviewed journal is to explore the origins, design, worship, spiritual philosophy, doctrines of the temples, architecture, temple work of the Tamils, charity, music and musical instruments, folk music, temple folk, the spiritual hymns of the sect, Tamil Bhakthi literature, Bhakthi literature in general to Hindu religion from any language of India and Abroad and universal temple art. It gives more chances and acts as a pioneer to the academicians, research scholars and freelancers who focus on the Bhakthi heritage, tradition and literature from Literatures of various Indian languages.</p>

			<title>[ October 16, 2024] Talk or similar: Sharif International School on Theism: East and West</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123910</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Elliott Sober (University of Wisconsin, Madison)<br/>Denis Alexander<br/>Erkki V. R. Kojonen<br/>Herman Johan Selderhuis<br/>Michael J. Behe<br/>Sara Walker<br/>Zachary Ardern<br/>Shoaib Ahmed Malik<br/>Nidhal Guessoum<br/>Mohammadsaleh Zarepour<br/>Naeime Pourmohammadi<br/>Seyed Hassan Hosseini<br/>Reza Naderloo<br/><br/><p><strong>“Sharif International School on Theism: East and West”</strong> is a theological-philosophical event having a 10-year vision. Its first three years were planned for 2021, 2022 and 2023. For three years in a row, these schools have focused on three categories:<strong> “God,” “Man” and “Nature”.</strong> The first school, centering on “God”, took place in 2021, and featured distinguished international professors. This event was around the main themes of God, including concepts, proofs, attributes, and actions. The second school was conducted online in 2022, focusing on “Man” and delved into topics such as the mind-body problem, the problem of evil, and the problem of free will. The third one named “Nature”, was held in 2023, featuring top international professors. This school had organized its curriculum into three categories: natural kinds, laws of nature, and teleology. Now, for the second three years of the school, we intend to focus our attention on Theism and its relations with natural and social sciences. <strong>The fourth school will be on Theism and Natural Sciences: with special scrutiny of Foundations, Theoretical Contemplations, and Evolutionary Explanations, and it is scheduled to be held online on October 16-19, 2024.</strong> Our aim is to host distinguished and renowned Iranian and international professors specializing in theism and science.</p></description>

A pithy, and probably<br/>belated, realization that though a lot of academic work seems to be blithely happening on<br/>“community,” not much still seems to be happening in/to the communities, was the trigger to<br/>reach out to other scholars in similar predicaments and whose research also intersects with<br/>various community form(ul)ations.<br/>But, indeed, a lot seem to be still happening in/to various caste-tribal-communities, then as well<br/>as now, regardless of “our” understanding, or lack thereof. Hence, the central question, in a way,<br/>would be whether we can ever again re-think the question of community in the wake of, and re-<br/>awaken, Ambedkar? For, thinking community is rethinking Ambedkar, in almost every way. And<br/>probably vice versa as well. Therefore, this conference invites scholars and researchers to<br/>“closely” re-read Ambedkar as well as juxtapose his thoughts with other figures and figurations<br/>from the subcontinent, if only to re-conceive a critical framing of what, how, where, why and<br/>when is Ambedkar’s community, and, significantly, also the other way round, today?<br/>As such, even today, this would be to start afresh, to adopt a comparative approach that invites,<br/>even enjoins, all of us to co(a)gitate and contribute to, at least, the emerging scholarship on both<br/>“Ambedkar” and “community,” if only within the Humanities and the Social Sciences, for now.<br/>Hence, as an overture, we invite papers/presentations that explore the questions of community<br/>vis-a-viz Ambedkar, and vice versa, especially in relation to the many anti-casteist and religious<br/>traditions, movements and writings from across the country that have been generally overlooked<br/>by Ambedkar studies.<br/>Firstly, we would like to foreground Ambedkar’s readings of various caste-community<br/>subjectivities and sovereignties. If Ambedkar is a spatial scholar and temporal actor who<br/>interconnects communities, did he foreground a community of critique, over the long 20 th<br/>century, through Buddhism? The conference hopes to generate a differential reading of<br/>Ambedkar, as a critical thinker and writer on community of his times, but who is still a<br/>monumental, if not a spectral, force for our times.<br/>Secondly, the conference looks forward to engagements of a nuanced and more rigorous<br/>comparison of Ambedkar with other resistant or recalcitrant figures of his/our times in order to</p>
<p>configure possibilities of mediation from different, although connected, intellectual traditions<br/>and histories—not only from the anti-casteist movements in the country, but also through the<br/>centrifugal ruptures from northern-southern-western-and-eastern regions of the nationalized-<br/>subcontinent. Through the very many figures, who embodied such digressive imaginaires and<br/>discourses, such as Periyar E.V. Ramasamy (1879-1973), Naoria Phulo (1888-1941), Abul Kalam<br/>Azad (1888-1958), Sahodaran Ayyapan (1889-1968), and many such others. Ambedkar may also<br/>be brought into an unconventional conversation with his contemporaries, such as Marx,<br/>Gramsci, Benjamin, Fanon and Du Bois, and with Jinnah, Gandhi, Tagore, Nehru, Patel and<br/>many others.<br/>And lastly, we also would like to focus on the re-presentations of Ambedkar, mediated through<br/>journals, cinema, cartoons and movements across time. We invite scholarly evaluations as well as<br/>accounts on the critical figuration of Ambedkar as a communicator and a communicated<br/>phenomenon.<br/>Altogether, this conference would primarily revolve around Ambedkar’s many lives in the<br/>imaginations and reconfigurations of communities. And, of course, vice versa. Hence, the<br/>conference, at once, attempts to be a timely document and a momentary reflection on the<br/>constituted world of/on Ambedkar in the context of an unprecedented amendment to the ideas<br/>of imagined political communities.<br/>Dates to Remember:<br/>Those interested should upload the Abstracts of about 600 words to:<br/><a href="https://forms.gle/CERZhVZhccrSCdm27">https://forms.gle/CERZhVZhccrSCdm27</a> by 22 June 2024.<br/>If accepted, drafts of full papers should be emailed by 31 August 2024.<br/>Paper presenters will be provided local hospitality (including accommodation) &amp;amp; TA as per UoH norms.<br/>For others, a token registration fee of Rs. 500/- for faculty and Rs. 300/- for students will ensure<br/>limited hospitality, excluding accommodation.<br/>Link for online registration: <a href="https://forms.gle/3pSpjRuRWD6K3jAN9">https://forms.gle/3pSpjRuRWD6K3jAN9</a></p>

						<description><p>After the initial 2023 symposium on philosophising in Mary in general, the 2024 edition will focus on one particular area where philosophising in Mary might bear fruit: political philosophy. The overall question is whether Mary can be a fruitful model or source of inspiration to develop a philosophical concept of the state, or of the nature of the political in general, that is neither atheist nor theocratic.   For more information: <a href="https://sedessapientiae.be/2024-2/theme-mary-and-political-philosophy/">https://sedessapientiae.be/2024-2/theme-mary-and-political-philosophy/</a>   The preliminary list of speakers includes Adrian Vermeule (Harvard), Sarah Jane Boss (Centre for Marian Studies), Pater Edmund Waldstein OCist. (Heiligenkreuz), Rocco Buttiglione (St. Pius V), Fr. Dirk Hanssens OSB (Keizersberg).   Deadline for abstract submission: June 30th, 2024. Notification of acceptance: July 15th, 2024.   This 2024 edition is organised by Michaël Bauwens (University of Antwerp) and Jared Schumacher (University of Mary).</p></description>

			<title>[ January 8, 2025] CFP for conference or similar: Phenomenology and Mysticism</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123866</link>
						<description><p>Call for Papers:  Panel sponsored by SOPHERE (the Society for the Phenomenology of Religious Experience) at the Eastern Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association, 2025 <br/> Conference Panel Theme: Phenomenology and Mysticism</p>
<p>The Society for the Phenomenology of Religious Experience (SoPheRE) will be hosting a panel discussion on the topic “Phenomenology and Mysticism” at the Eastern Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association in  New York City from January 8-11, 2025. We hereby invite papers related to that theme. Possible topics to be covered include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>--What is mysticism?  What is a mystical experience?  </p>
<p>--How do we differentiate between mystical experiences of the divine and non-mystical experiences of religious life or faith or community?  </p>
<p>--What kinds of ethical imperatives, if any, do mystical experiences or mystical writings carry?  And how and why might they carry these imperatives? </p>
<p>--How private are mystical experiences?  Can there be public ones?  If so, how are mystical experiences recognized and furthered as shared experiences? </p>
<p>--What are  resources in the  Continental and phenomenological tradition that might assist us in order to articulate the possibility or impossibility of mysticism—resources such as those in the works of Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, GWF Hegel, Jean-Luc Marion, Edith Stein, Meister Eckhart, Martin Heidegger, John Caputo, and others?</p>
<p>--How does art or literature demonstrate or call for a new kind of space or temporality that forms the structure or possibility of mysticism?</p>
<p>Papers should involve texts and discussions of phenomenology (and the phenomenological tradition within philosophy).  The papers should be designed for a maximum of 30 minutes reading time (approx. 3500 words) and be submitted for blind review by July 20, 2024. Accepted papers will be notified by August 5, 2024. All presenters must register for the Eastern Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association and be current members of SOPHERE (www.sophere.org).

						<description><p><strong>METAPHYSICS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>The 2025 APA Central Division Meeting will be held February 20-22, 2025, and February 27-March 1. All sessions will be on-line. The Society for Phenomenology of Religious Experience will sponsor an affiliated group session on metaphysics and religious experience.</p>
<p>Many of those who have religious/spiritual experiences find systematic metaphysics irrelevant to those experiences, and yet one might wonder whether they do depend on unexamined metaphysical presuppositions. This session will inquire into the relationship between religious/spiritual experience and metaphysics. Are religious/spiritual experiences completely independent of metaphysics? Or, do they depend on metaphysics? If so, how? If religious/spiritual experiences do depend in some way on metaphysics, do the different metaphysical frameworks people espouse (and these are often diverse, depending on the diversity of religious/spiritual traditions and cultures world-wide) affect the kinds of religious/spiritual experience they have? Does religious/spiritual experience determine what metaphysical outlook should be adopted (e.g. Classical Theism or Process Theology)? Is there a danger of equating metaphysics with religious/spiritual experience? Does such an equation end up undermining religious/spiritual experience or end up in incoherence as various critiques of onto-theology suggest? Do metaphysics and religious/spiritual experience represent distinctive and yet related provinces of meaning, in Alfred Schutz’s sense? Is there a philosophical obligation to give an account of the metaphysical suppositions underlying one religious/spiritual experience out of a sense of philosophical responsibility in Husserl’s sense? Do metaphysical articulations help build a bridge between religious/spiritual experience and science, as Max Scheler thought? Papers ought to make use in some way of phenomenological methodology. Abstracts of up to 500 words or completed papers should be sent to apacentral@sophere.org by August 1.</p>

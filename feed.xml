<p>Religious Communities in the Virtual Age:</p>
<p>Practices, Values, Technologies, Boundaries</p>
<p>28 October 2024, Manchester, England</p>
<p>Keynote Speaker: Prof Linda Woodhead, King’s College London.</p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, religious communities across Europe and the world have engaged with the</p>
<p>digital world and specific digital technologies in a wide variety of ways. Some have embraced online</p>
<p>worship and gathering as a tool for widening or enriching a sense of community. Others have used social</p>
<p>media to re-think the boundaries of their work with their wider society around them or to connect with</p>
<p>their co-religionists across the world. Still others have consciously avoided digital tools, seeing a spiritual</p>
<p>and social potency in in-person gathering that cannot be replicated. But nearly all have had to face the new</p>
<p>assumptions and practices of the virtual age that the pandemic made far more universal than they were</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>How have these engagements with the technologies, practices and norms of the virtual age changed the</p>
<p>lives of religious communities? How has it affected their sense of community, their understanding of the</p>
<p>borders of membership, or their relationship with the wider world? What has it meant for the means and</p>
<p>potencies of collective worship? How has it changed patterns of authority and decision making? How have</p>
<p>notions of sacred place and time been affected by the virtual? How do communities navigate notions of</p>
<p>‘appropriate’ or ‘genuine’ in the context of the digital society?</p>
<p>This conference will bring together scholars investigating these questions in a range of religious</p>
<p>communities, from large and dominant ones to established minorities and marginalised or immigrant</p>
<p>groups, and from a range of national contexts. It centres around the work of the EU-CHANSE funded</p>
<p>project Religious Communities in the Virtual Age (recovira.org), but welcomes other scholars in dialogue</p>
<p>with these concerns from fields such as the study of religion, sociology, theology, performance,</p>
<p>anthropology, cultural studies and so on. While the focus is on the lives of religious communities in the</p>
<p>post-pandemic era and papers are necessarily limited to 10-15 minutes, we are interested in case studies,</p>
<p>comparative, and theoretical approaches.</p>
<p>Please note: This conference will take place in central Manchester. Conference fees, which will include a</p>
<p>catered lunch, will be kept to a minimum (under £20). In-person attendance will be limited by the size of</p>
<p>the venue. While offsite, online presentation will not be possible for this conference, it will be streamed for</p>
<p>those who wish to watch. Online viewing will require pre-booking, which will be free.</p>
<p>Abstract submissions are due 10th May 2024</p>
<p>We hope to notify applicants by 31st May 2024</p>
<p>Please submit abstracts via this form: <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/ppidGy9jUr">https://forms.office.com/e/ppidGy9jUr</a></p>
<p>With any questions, please contact the project team at <a href="mailto:recovira@mmu.ac.uk">recovira@mmu.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>This conference is sponsored by the Performance Research Group, Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>

Clarence Rivers, the “father of Black Catholic liturgy,” and the 40th anniversary of the Black Bishops of the United States’ pastoral letter, “What We Have Seen and Heard.” In addition to keynote addresses and workshops inspired by Fr. Rivers and “What We Have Seen and Heard,” we will also have opportunities to gather for song and prayer in the traditions of soulful worship called for by Fr. Rivers and “What We Have Seen and Heard.” The symposium will take place Friday and Saturday at Curran Place on the University of Dayton campus, and the weekend’s events will culminate in Sunday Eucharist at 11:00am ET on November 24 at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Peter in Chains in Cincinnati, with Wilton Cardinal Gregory, the first African American Catholic cardinal, presiding and preaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fr. Rivers’ work in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and beyond tore down walls of racial exclusion and placed the American Church on a path toward acceptance of all its members—a path we continue to walk, often with faltering steps. To honor Rivers’ legacy, to heed the call of “What We Have Seen and Heard” encouraging our pilgrimage toward greater unity, and in the Akan spirit of “sankofa” (learning from the past as we move into the future), the Office of African American Pastoral Ministries, partnering with the University of Dayton, has prepared a series of events to commemorate these important anniversaries in November 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keynote speakers for the events include Dr. Kim Harris, Dr. Joseph Brown, SJ, and Wilton Cardinal Gregory. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Proposals:</p>
<p dir="ltr">In-person presenters are sought for the Symposium at University of Dayton who will:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Thoughtfully synthesize our two guiding themes of the event—the impact of “What We Have Seen and Heard” and the life and legacy of Fr. Rivers—from their areas of expertise such as theology, liturgy, music, history, art, literature, catechetics, etc.;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Engage Symposium participants in active learning and reflection on these themes (workshops or presentations are sought, rather than papers);</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Craft and deliver an in-person presentation offering innovative perspectives and scholarship on these themes, demonstrating their continued relevance;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Be a present and active participant in all Symposium events (Friday-Sunday morning) as possible. (Funds will be provided for travel; see below.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Please submit a 300-500 word proposal for an interactive Workshop or Breakout session of approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes in length, along with a 100-word biographical statement, via email to Emily Strand <a href="mailto:emilykcstrand@gmail.com">emilykcstrand@gmail.com</a> and Dr. Cecilia Moore <a href="mailto:cmoore1@udayton.edu">cmoore1@udayton.edu</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resources:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Access to Fr. Rivers’ written works can be made available upon request.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Funding:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Those selected for Workshops or Breakout presentations will receive funds for travel, paid accommodations, airport transportation and travel to the Mass in Cincinnati, as well as a modest honorarium.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Key dates:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Deadline for submissions: Monday, July 1, 2024</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notification of selected presenters: by Monday, July 29, 2024</p>
<p dir="ltr">Event dates: Friday, November 22, 2024 through Sunday, November 24, 2024</p>
<p dir="ltr">These events are sponsored by the generous support of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, the University of Dayton, and the podcast Meet Father Rivers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Questions:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please direct questions to Emily Strand at <a href="mailto:emilykcstrand@gmail.com">emilykcstrand@gmail.com</a> or Dr. Cecilia Moore at <a href="mailto:cmoore1@udayton.edu">cmoore1@udayton.edu</a>. </p>

			<title>[ May 1, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Bergson: Translating Duration (PAMLA special session)</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/122502</link>
						<description><p>In accordance with the conference theme, “Translation in Action,” the work of French philosopher Henri Bergson is more than relevant. Bergson’s work was written in French and translations are often offered with notes about the richness of his words and potential loss of meaning. Questions of translation surround and even permeate Bergson philosophy.</p>
<p>Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927 “in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented,” Bergson drew on descriptive and visual models to demonstrate complex ideas. He was a pioneering philosopher showing interest in film, utilizing the flow of moving images to explain concepts of memory and relativity. Questions of translation surround and even permeate Bergson philosophy.</p>
<p>In addition to the questions related to translating Bergson’s French into other languages, on a deeper and more complex layer, there are questions of translating the inner experience of consciousness, the “ineffable” immediate feeling involved in each moment as having a singularly unique nuance. Bergson's point is clear in the case of the peculiarity of each <em>sui generis </em>effort and idea of an artist. No less rich is every moment of our own inner life, even if we lack the words to express it, or the attentiveness to appreciate it. As poet Paul Valery said, "The most powerful and unprecedented images and metaphors obeyed [Bergson's] desire to reconstruct, in the consciousness of others, the discoveries he made in his own, and the results of his internal experiments." Bergson makes translation a fundamental goal of all philosophy, even when communicating in one's own language.</p>
<p>This session invites papers that explore the many facets of Bergson’s philosophy especially those related to the conference theme.</p>

<p><strong>(Editor: Danutė Bacevičiūtė)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thematic issue “Notions of Responsibility in Contemporary Discourse: Ethics, Law, Politics”</strong> </p>
<p>The challenges of the current world – the Covid-19 pandemic, the migrant crisis, ecological problems – have emphasized the need to return to the problem of responsibility. This return requires the consideration of not only the genesis of the concept of responsibility in the Western philosophical tradition (cf. P. Ricoeur „Le concept de responsabilité. Essai d’analyse sémantique“, 1994; F. Raffoul Origins of Responsibility, 2010), but also of new methodological approaches. The traditional notion of responsibility, based on an autonomous person responsible for the consequences of one’s own actions, is being replaced by an awareness of the social, technological, and ecological connectivity that inevitably leads to collective action, compensation for damages, and assistance to the victim. This collective action presupposes not only the mutual responsibility of the people living now, but also the intergenerational responsibility – the relationship with the past and future generations (cf. H. Jonas, T. Andina). However, the expanded field of responsibility does not necessarily imply that the person takes responsibility and guilt, as the connection of a person’s specific decision or choice with this globally expanded field becomes unclear and difficult to grasp (T. Clark, J. Derrida). Moreover, liability insurance that covers many areas of social life (in the form of various taxes) is a potential precondition for solidarity yet the content of such solidarity and responsibility remains vague, as the responsible person is replaced by the insurance network system. “Athena: Philosophical Studies” no. 19 is intended to summarize the problem of responsibility placed at the intersection of ethics, law, and politics.</p>

			<title>[ September 4, 2025 -  September 6, 2025] Conference or similar: The British Society for the Philosophy of Religion, 2025 Biennial Conference: Creativity and Creation</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/122346</link>
						<description>Venue: Lady Margaret Hall<br/><br/><p><strong>The BSPR’s Sixteenth Conference</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creativity and Creation</strong></p>
<p><strong>4th – 6th September, 2025 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford</strong></p>
<p>The 2025 conference theme encompasses both human creativity and divine creation, across the full range of religious and philosophical traditions, theistic or otherwise. Presentations may focus on either human creativity or divine creation, or consider the relationship between the two. They may explore the metaphysics, ethics or phenomenology of creative acts (human or divine). We welcome philosophical reflection on the role of the arts in religious life and thought. We also want to consider the creative aspects of philosophical work itself. Conceptual and historical approaches are equally welcome, and attention to both practice and theory is warmly encouraged.</p>
<p>Questions addressed by the conference may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the relationship between human creativity and divine creation?</li>
<li>To what extent is philosophical thinking a creative activity?</li>
<li>How can we think philosophically about the role of the arts in religious life?</li>
<li>What is the connection between creativity and desire? knowledge? freedom? flourishing?</li>
<li>What account of agency underpins our conceptions of creation and creativity?</li>
<li>How do alternative models of theism (e.g. pantheism, panentheism, polytheism, classical monotheism) conceptualise creation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our CFP will open on January 1st 2025 and close on March 31st 2025. Registration (via Eventbrite) will also open in early 2025.</p></description>

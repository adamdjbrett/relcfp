			<title>[ January 20, 2023 -  January 21, 2023] Conference or similar: Jean Cavaillès and his intellectual milieu</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106254</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The last decade has witnessed a renewed interest in the work of Jean Cavaillès (1903-1944). Cavaillès specialized in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of science, though his oeuvre was cut short due to his death in the French Resistance. Nonetheless, his work proved to be very influential in France, impacting the work of, among others, Gaston Bachelard, Georges Canguilhem, Jean-Toussaint Desanti, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Jules Vuillemin, Gilles-Gaston Granger and Jacques Bouveressse.  Hence, this interest goes hand in hand with a revival of studies on ‘French epistemology’ or historical epistemology. In the case of Cavaillès, the new focus is not only on his philosophy of mathematics but also on his broader program for a theory of science based on a conceptual dynamics. In this process of rediscovery the intellectual milieu of French philosophy and history of science between 1920 and 1950 plays its role and gets its share. The exchanges between Cavaillès and Albert Lautman, the connection with Gaston and Suzanne Bachelard, the Dialectica movement around Ferdinand Gonseth, the relations with the founders of Bourbaki, the formation of the new generation of students (Granger, Vuillemin, Desanti), the friendship with Georges Canguilhem, etc. all deserve to be highlighted.</p></description>

Proposals are welcome focusing on any religious group in the period (including conformists, Puritans, Protestant Nonconformists/Dissenters, Catholics, freethinkers, Jews and Muslims) and the relationships between them, and on any kind or genre of writing, but papers should have a clear link to the southwest region.</p><p>Possible topics may include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Devotional, polemical, didactic and narrative modes of religious writing, and their dissemination via manuscript circulation and the printed book trade.</li><li>The role of religion in political upheavals in the southwest, such as the Prayer Book Rebellion/Western Rising of 1549, the Civil Wars, and the Glorious Revolution.</li><li>The shaping and practice of conformist/‘Anglican’ religion by writers including theologians such as Richard Hooker and poets such as Robert Herrick.</li><li>Texts emerging from or responding to Dissenters in the southwest including Presbyterians, Independents/Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, Unitarians and Methodists.</li><li>The Exeter Arian controversy and the split between ‘orthodox’ and ‘rational’ Dissent.</li><li>Jewish communities in the southwest, including the Ottolenghi Affair of the 1730s.</li><li>Encounters with the Islamic world (e.g. via travel writing and captivity narratives).</li></ul><p>Within this religiously plural and contested region, individuals and religious groups expressed their convictions and communal identities as well as their relationships and conflicts with others through a wide variety of written genres. These texts include poems, sermons, prophecies, pamphlets, letters, travel writing, captivity narratives, diaries, memoirs, and spiritual autobiographies. We welcome exploration of such texts from a variety of methodological approaches, including approaches derived from history, literary studies, bibliography, theology, network analysis and more. We anticipate these discussions providing unique insights into the construction of shared identities and collective memories, and the ways in which these play out in local histories of community and conflict. An edited collection of selected papers from the conference is also envisaged for publication.</p><p>Please send a biography (100 words), along with a CV, title and brief abstract (250 words) of a 20 minute paper, or for panels (3 x 20 minute papers) to <a href="mailto:d.parry@exeter.ac.uk">d.parry@exeter.ac.uk</a> by 13th January 2023.  Early expressions of interest welcome.

In Roux’s argument (2010), the metaphysical conviction underpinning developments in mathematization between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries gave rise to claims that all natural phenomena can be submitted to mathematics, and that mathematics was the transparent language of nature: another grand narrative, whose effectiveness and continuation each requires further examination. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Hence for Albertson (2014), as for Goulding (2010) and Oosterhoff (2018), closer attention to mathesis’ genealogy; its continuities with premodern epistemes and ontologies; as well as the contiguities and conflicts shared by mathematized science, language, and religion, is  essential. Critiquing the longer transmissions of these early modern conceptual processes may even prove crucial to our understanding of late modernity: a period in which forces of mathematization increasingly form the matrix in which life is compulsorily contained. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Drawing upon the Irish philosopher of science Ernan McMullin’s idea of consonance (1984), this multi-disciplinary conference therefore explores the interplay between mathematized logic, language, morality, and understandings of nature in premodern and modern eras from Western and Global perspectives. Acknowledging, though independent from, McMullin’s theological imperative, <em><strong>Consonances</strong></em> encourages contributions from historians of science, philosophy, and theology which ‘retain the autonomy of each discipline [...] in ways which do not fall into conflict’ (Allen, 2008, 134). </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Our suggested timeframe is from c.700 to c.1750; however, this is only a suggestion, and papers considering other periods are welcome. We invite proposals for <strong>individual</strong> or <strong>collaborative papers</strong> of<strong> 20 minutes</strong>. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span>Intersections of mathematics, literature, and natural philosophies and theologies across religious, cultural, and epistemological boundaries</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Relations of method, moral arguments, mathematical praxis, and social mobility in the premodern world </span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span> The Christianization of Neopythagorean and Neoplatonic mathesis; transmissions, successes, failures  </span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>The intersection of number, natural environment, and modes of transcendence</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Mathematics, language, and the vita contemplativa </span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span> Longer-term and/or ‘lost’ traditions of hermeneutical inquiry in ‘mathematical theologies’</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Resolving conflict through dialogical, mathematico-philosophical, and/or hermeneutical strategies</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Apophatic practices across interlinked knowledge-traditions.</span></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>We encourage contributions from <strong>PhD students and early career scholars</strong>, and will aim to publish a selection of papers from the conference as an edited collection or as a special issue in a peer-reviewed journal. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Please submit an abstract (c.250 words) and a brief biography to <a

<p align="center"><strong>Friday 21st April 2023</strong></p>
<p align="center">Organised by Leverhulme Trust-funded project ‘Writing Religious Conflict and Community in Exeter’ (ReConEx) in association with the International John Bunyan Society with the endorsement of the Ecclesiastical History Society.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Proposals are invited for a day conference at the University of Exeter on religious identity, community and conflict in the southwest of England from 1500-1800, and their representation in written and printed texts. Proposals are welcome focusing on any religious group in the period (including conformists, Puritans, Protestant Nonconformists/Dissenters, Catholics, freethinkers, Jews and Muslims) and the relationships between them, and on any kind or genre of writing, but papers should have a clear link to the southwest region.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Possible topics may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Devotional, polemical, didactic and narrative modes of religious writing, and their dissemination via manuscript circulation and the printed book trade.</li>
<li>The role of religion in political upheavals in the southwest, such as the Prayer Book Rebellion/Western Rising of 1549, the Civil Wars, and the Glorious Revolution.</li>
<li>The shaping and practice of conformist/‘Anglican’ religion by writers including theologians such as Richard Hooker and poets such as Robert Herrick.</li>
<li>Texts emerging from or responding to Dissenters in the southwest including Presbyterians, Independents/Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, Unitarians and Methodists.</li>
<li>The Exeter Arian controversy and the split between ‘orthodox’ and ‘rational’ Dissent.</li>
<li>Jewish communities in the southwest, including the Ottolenghi Affair of the 1730s.</li>
<li>Encounters with the Islamic world (e.g. via travel writing and captivity narratives).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Within this religiously plural and contested region, individuals and religious groups expressed their convictions and communal identities as well as their relationships and conflicts with others through a wide variety of written genres. These texts include poems, sermons, prophecies, pamphlets, letters, travel writing, captivity narratives, diaries, memoirs, and spiritual autobiographies. We welcome exploration of such texts from a variety of methodological approaches, including approaches derived from history, literary studies, bibliography, theology, network analysis and more. We anticipate these discussions providing unique insights into the construction of shared identities and collective memories, and the ways in which these play out in local histories of community and conflict. An edited collection of selected papers from the conference is also envisaged for publication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please send a biography (100 words), along with a CV, title and brief abstract (250 words) of a 20 minute paper, or for panels (3 x 20 minute papers) to <a href="mailto:d.parry@exeter.ac.uk">d.parry@exeter.ac.uk</a> by 13th January 2023.  Early expressions of interest welcome. Remote participation may be possible for participants unable to travel to Exeter – please get in touch if this would be of interest. Modest travel bursaries (on request via e-mail) are available for postgraduate students whose papers are accepted.</p>

Two decades later, we hope to bring a similarly fresh perspective to the study of medieval religion with <em>The Medieval Church: From Margins to Centre</em>, a two-day conference to be held on 26–27 June 2023 at the Humanities Research Centre, University of York, with the generous support of the Centre for Medieval Studies and the Department of History (York).</p>
<p>This conference aims to consider the relationship between the Church and the marginalised in medieval society – minority genders and sexualities, racial minorities, disabled people, non-Christians, and the poor. How did the Church respond to, oppress, or offer opportunities to those on the margins, and how did marginalised individuals and groups exercise agency through their interactions with the institutions and mechanisms of the Church? We are interested in both the ‘positive’ – for example, how the church supported the poor, holy models of disability and transgender experience – and the ‘negative’, such as the Church’s role in the creation and maintenance of social prejudices. We welcome papers from researchers working across the medieval period (from c.400-1500) as well as different geographic regions (including papers on other denominations of Christianity, as well as the Church outside of Europe), and with disciplinary focuses including but not limited to History, Literary Studies, Art History and Archaeology.</p>
<p>The conference is prompted by current trends in medieval race studies, trans studies and disability studies, and aims to provide a particular platform for postgraduate and early career researchers who work in these areas. To support this aim, we plan to offer a bursary of £30 per person for up to 10 postgraduates and ECRs. If you are interested in being considered for a bursary, please indicate this when you send in your proposal. We aim to host this conference in a hybrid format, so please also indicate whether you would be interested in presenting in-person in York or online.</p>
<p><strong>Please send abstracts of up to 250 words to Tim Wingard (</strong><a href="mailto:tim.wingard@york.ac.uk"><strong>tim.wingard@york.ac.uk</strong></a><strong>) by no later than 5pm on Sunday 5 February 2023. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. </strong></p>

<p>ATHE’s conference theme evokes strong emotions, stirs our senses viscerally, and requires focused action towards healing and progressive change. Organizationally, we are standing in the rubble continuing to deconstruct harmful structures of racism, white supremacy, neoliberalism, cisheteropatriarchy, and ableism. Similarly, ATHE’s Religion and Theatre Focus Group membership stand in the debris aware of the unconscionable sustainment of our explicit and implicit participation in these inequitable structures within our programming and name. Our programming has historically overrepresented Western Christian and Ashkenazi Jewish scholarship and performances. Our name, an outward-facing feature of our group, implies a prioritization of religious scholarship over spiritual scholarship, and theatre performances over other performances. As we shift and start to rebrand our focus group, we re-affirm our commitment to foster diverse, equitable, and inclusive representation of the literature, rituals, performances, and performatives of global religious and spiritual scholarship, pedagogies, and practices. We re-commit to pro-actively seek multi-disciplinary focus group partnerships, as well as to include a breadth of conference proposal formats, such as traditional paper presentations, performance-based presentations, workshops, working groups, poster presentations, and roundtables. We invite you to triage with us in the rubble this academic year as we build a better, stronger, more equitable future at our hybrid conference in 2023. Some possible proposal topics or “calls-to-action” for the upcoming conference may address (but are not limited to addressing):</p>
<p>● How do global religions and spiritualities peacefully navigate “moments of chaos in the rubble” through performance and ritual praxis?</p>
<p>● How are global religions and spiritualities extending care to the most vulnerable (especially intersectional communities) in performances, performatives, rituals, literature, etc.?</p>
<p>● How are global religions and spiritualities engaging with one another in fruitful interfaith performance and performative dialogue? How can these conversations continue to be fostered?</p>
<p>● How do we identify the harmful impacts of global religious and spiritual practices in socio-political structures and governances? What transformative interventions can be applied?</p>
<p>● What lessons can we learn from failures of unconditional love, care, and acceptance by global religions and spiritualities in performance or ritual praxis, infrastructurally, and/or in theological or other scholarly discourse?</p>
<p>● How does ATHE’s Religion &amp; Theatre Focus Group contribute to or reinforce an unsustainable and inequitable system? How can we continue to practically work towards equitable and inclusive transformation?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Submission Guidelines:</p>
<p>• Papers should be approximately 8 to 10 pages in length</p>
<p>• Please include a cover page with your name, paper title, institutional affiliation, contact information, and a brief abstract (250 words). Please remove your name from the body of the submission, as it will go through a blind vetting process.</p>
<p>• Send your paper, bio, and cover page in one word document by April 1, 2023 (extended deadline) to JM Christiansen at <a href="mailto:jacob.christiansen@umontana.edu">jacob.christiansen@umontana.edu</a>.</p>

			<title>[ April 15, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Phenomenology and History</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106165</link>
						<description><p>Phenomenology was originally designed to be a science that attempted to overcome particular and accidental determinants. For many scholars, this attempt meant that phenomenology should focus, as some argued, on timeless and non-historical meanings and essences. This reading, however, was misleading and did not do justice to the nuanced way in which “the historical” was approached by Husserl and his followers (and critics). Given a thorough analysis of inner time-consciousness, passive synthesis, and the phenomenon of sedimentation, it became evident that “the historical” is a crucial component not only of the past, but of the very experience of the present.</p>
<p>The phenomenology of history is not only an important part of phenomenological studies, but also opens new perspectives on the history of philosophy, as is the case in the writings of Husserl, Heidegger, Patočka, and Marion, to mention only a few authors. A phenomenological approach to the history of philosophy points out that it is about discovering the “closed-off” dimension of the original philosophical evidence. This is not closed off because the meanings in question are fixed once and for all and are not amenable to any transformation, but because what is at stake is the evidence that internally supported the construction of the philosophical positions of the past, yet at the same time was not exposed in a sufficiently clear and adequate manner. When the philosophical positions of the past were shaped, the evidence that actually motivated and initiated the emergence of certain philosophies remained a sediment that has not yet been reactivated, i.e., brought to itself-givenness in such a way that its crucial effect can be appreciated for what it is. Moreover, being-closed-off as a feature of the original evidence also means that the history of philosophy represents a unique movement. What drove its development over and over again was a <em>telos</em> that was common to all relevant philosophical positions of the past, yet remained closed off within them—which meant that no philosophy was able to realize the <em>telos</em> present in it, a <em>telos</em> to which it owes its legitimation within the historical flow of philosophy.</p>
<p>Unlike Hegel’s notion, the phenomenological notion of teleological history does not rest upon the idea of development: Husserl’s convincing analysis focused on the factual state of philosophical research suggests that history is about the internal breakdown of its guiding idea rather than about a successful and fruitful path to its fulfillment and realization. According to his remark expressed at the beginning of the <em>Crisis</em>, “the whole historical process has a remarkable form, one which become visible only through an interpretation of its hidden innermost motivation. Its form is not that of a smooth development, not that of a continual growth of lasting spiritual acquisitions or of a transformation of spiritual configurations—concepts, theories, systems—which can be explained by means of the accidental historical situations” (<em>Crisis</em>, 11–12).</p>
<p>The thematic scope of the conference will include (but is not limited to) the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Husserl and his followers (and critics) on the history of philosophy;</li>
<li>approaches to history and history of philosophy in the writings of Heidegger, Ingarden, Arendt, Patočka, Carr, and others;</li>
<li>history and history of philosophy from the viewpoint of French phenomenologists, including Levinas, Merleau-Ponty, Richir, Marion, Barbaras, and others;</li>
<li>roots and contexts (e.g., Brentano) of the phenomenological account of the history of philosophy;</li>
<li>phenomenological methods of exploring the phenomenon of history;</li>
<li>eidos and historical sedimentations in the history of philosophy;</li>
<li>on the (im-)possibility of a transcendental phenomenology of history;</li>
<li>history and time;</li>
<li>history and structures of (timeless) meaning;</li>
<li>the phenomenon of history and the historicity of phenomena;</li>
<li>new approaches to the history of the Phenomenological Movement.</li>
</ul>

To date, there has been considerable scholarship on how various ethnolinguistic groups (e.g., Swahili) and areas (e.g., the Indian Ocean) in Africa in which Islam and Islamic religious culture feature prominently have been implicated in regional, transregional, and global entanglements across space and time. There is also growing scholarship on Asia-Africa and Middle East-Africa, as well as on shifting geopolitics in a multipolar world. However, broader attempts to conceptualize such transregional and global entanglements beyond such case studies as they relate to Islam and Muslim societies have been rather limited. Given the broader objectives of analytical and comparative reflection about Islam in Africa in global context, presenters will cast new light on African engagements with Islam and some of the transregional and global connections African Muslims have forged, as well as the implications such connections have for understanding Islam in a globalizing world. The panel invites papers dealing with African engagements with Islam at the intersection of the local, the transregional, and the global in various contexts across space and time using historical methods, ethnography, visual culture, and/or media studies.</span></span></p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><span><span><a name="_MailAutoSig"><span><span><span>Mara Leichtman</span></span></span></a></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Associate Professor<br/>Department of Anthropology<br/>Muslim Studies Program<br/>Michigan State University<br/>310 Baker Hall<br/>655 Auditorium Road<br/>East Lansing, MI  48824</span></span></span><br/><u><span><span><span><a href="mailto:maral@msu.edu">maral@msu.edu</a></span></span></span></u>  </span></span></p><p><span><span><a href="https://iupress.org/9780253016010/shii-cosmopolitanisms-in-africa/" rel="nofollow"><span><span><span>Shi'i Cosmopolitanisms in Africa: Lebanese Migration and Religious Conversion in Senegal</span></span></span></a></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:maral@msu.edu">maral@msu.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

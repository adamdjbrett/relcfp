<p>Conceptions and representations of the witch and witchcraft have intersected with experiences, beliefs, and projections concerning sexuality and the erotic throughout the development of the witch-figure and its antecedents.   This panel is open to papers exploring any aspect of this relationship, ranging from sexual and erotic aspects in mythic and popular representations (in any media) of the witch and witchcraft (and historical traditions that gave rise to them), associated antinomian, demonic and diabolical projections of witchcraft and witches (including sexual and erotic elements in the projections themselves) and related or secondarily and/or reciprocally inspired practices, sexual and erotic themes or motifs in intercultural projections and constructions of the witch-figure, and the role of sexuality and the erotic in traditional and neo-traditional witchcraft identities, beliefs, and practices, as well as their representations in cultural media.  Papers from any scholarly perspective and/or disciplinary approach will be considered, including papers addressing the role and/or representation of the witch or witchcraft beliefs and practices in sexual or erotic context in non-witchcraft traditions, as well papers addressing the influence of these elements of witchcraft traditions, beliefs, and practices on other traditions, in the context of sexuality and erotic experience.</p>
<p>If you would like to propose a paper to be presented in this special panel, or you would like more information about the requirements or the conference Area, please contact Dr. George Sieg, the Area Chair for Esotericism, Occultism, and Magic, directly at <a href="mailto:georgejsieg@gmail.com">georgejsieg@gmail.com</a></p>

<p><strong>"The Esoteric Turn as Methodological Reform in Art History"</strong></p>
<p>It is generally accepted that esotericism and occultism were pervasive strains in the production of modern Western art. However, art historical methodologies are often reductive and inadequate to the study of exceptional human experience. In the midst of an esoteric turn in the mainstream artworld, and surging interest in esotericism, occultism, and magic throughout media and popular culture, the forms of standardization embedded in disciplinary art history are in need of reform. This special panel invites presentations that seek to explore the necessity of disciplinary inclusion and methodological pluralism, and how such approaches can embody new ways of knowing and thinking, new epistemologies. Can we think of new ways of making sense of the background and interpretive context of artistic works? How might methods from seemingly disparate disciplines, humanities and the sciences, enhance an understanding of modern art with esoteric, occult, and magical themes? Can we articulate what’s missing from standard, conventional methods and propose new solutions? We invite artists, art historians, critics, and scholars to explore these questions and others as we engage the ongoing limitations in disciplinary art history in favor of more imaginative grounding.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: Deleuze and Guattari Studies Special Issue "Space, Control, Resistance"<br/><br/><p><strong>Guest Editors: </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Milica Mađanović</p>
<p>Simona Žikić</p>
<p>George Hristov</p>
<p>The collection is dedicated to the theme of the <em>15th International Deleuze and Guattari Studies Conference and Camp</em>: ‘Space, Control, Resistance’.</p>
<p>The conference reengaged with Deleuze’s ‘Postscript on the Societies of Control’, in which he named ‘control’ as the ‘new monster’, and outlined a new arrangement of power in which ‘liberating and enslaving forces confront one another’ in a novel way.</p>
<p>The old societies of discipline, which Deleuze saw as the predecessor to those of control, operated through spaces of confinement and enclosure. Their crisis gave way to a different type of spatial organization of power: instead of discreet enclosures, we find ourselves in open spaces and within a continuous network. The enclosed and isolated body of the prison has given way to bodies in ‘open prisons’ and a nomadic psyche that carries the panopticon with(in) itself. However, these novel spaces of domination call for ‘new forms of resistance’, and also, new types of critique. By employing Deleuze and Guattari's conceptual framework, this special issue aims to explore the intersection of liberation and enslavement within these spaces and chart new paths for theory and critique.</p>
<p>We invite contributions from both those who presented at the conference and those who did not but wish to contribute to the issue. Papers that engage in conceptual and theoretical analysis, and arguments that seek to apply Deleuze and Guattari’s conceptual framework to specific fields, are equally welcome. The range of topics may include (but is certainly not limited to) the following:</p>
<p>-         Becoming of the concept of ‘control’ in Deleuze and Guattari’s thought</p>
<p>-         Comparison of Deleuze’s outline of control society and new ‘immanent critique’ to contemporaneous developments in other traditions (for example, Honneth’s redeployment of ‘immanent critique’ in recognition theory)</p>
<p>-         ‘Resistance’, ‘discipline’ and ‘control’ in Foucault, and Deleuze and Guattari</p>
<p>-         Digitalization and AI as new spaces of control and resistance</p>
<p>-         Control society and migration</p>
<p>-         Spaces of control, built environment and public infrastructure</p>
<p>-         Anthropocene studies and ecology</p>
<p>-         ‘Control’ and literature</p>
<p>-         Spaces of control, and visual and performing arts</p>
<p>-         Control and Marxism (transition to control as an evolution of capitalism)</p>
<p>-         The role of time and temporality in thinking new forms of resistance</p>
<p>Authors are kindly asked to send abstracts before submitting their complete manuscripts to ensure alignment with the issue’s themes. Please send your abstracts to the email address provided below by <strong>January 10, 2024</strong>. The abstracts should be between 250–400 words in length. Authors will receive notification of acceptance or rejection by January 31, 2024. It is important to note that approval of abstracts does not guarantee acceptance of final manuscripts.</p>
<p>The final contributions should be in the range of 6000–8000 words and adhere to the <em>Deleuze and Guattari Studies</em> style, which can be found at [<a href="https://www.euppublishing.com/loi/dlgs">https://www.euppublishing.com/loi/dlgs</a>]. The deadline for the first drafts of papers is <strong>July 1, 2024</strong>.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: Special Issue: Critical Phenomenology of the We<br/><br/><p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://puncta.journals.villanova.edu/"><em>Puncta. </em>Journal of Critical Phenomenology</a></p>
<p><strong>Special Issue: “Critical Phenomenology of the We”</strong></p>
<p><strong>-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>Phenomenology offers not only incisive analyses of intentionality, experience, selfhood, empathy and interpersonal understanding, but also quite sophisticated investigations of collective intentionality, affective sharing, social participation, communal experience, and group-identity. Indeed, while starting out with an interest in the individual mind, phenomenologists began exploring dyadic forms of interpersonal relations shortly before the start of World War I, and were deeply engaged in extensive analyses of communal forms of intentionality during the interwar period – at a time when nationalism was on the rise. Today, the "We" has not lost its place in philosophical, political, or popular discourse. Within the last decade, phenomenologists have shown how phenomenology can contribute to the “discovery of the We” (Szanto &amp; Moran 2016). These explorations have rediscovered lesser known early phenomenological writings on sociality by Gerda Walther, Edith Stein, Max Scheler or Aaron Gurwitsch and highlighted their relevance for contemporary problems in social cognition theory and analytic social ontology. Phenomenological approaches to sociality, we-experiences, and community, however, too-often concern themselves with ideal social ontological entities rather than the non-ideal social reality we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>A critical phenomenology of the We explores new lines of questioning at the intersection of phenomenology of sociality and critical phenomenology, putting pressure on the allegedly neutral and unpolitical nature of the recent phenomenological discovery of the We. This special issue serves the purpose of demonstrating how critical perspectives both on and within phenomenological analyses can be enriching for philosophical discussions of the We and sociality more broadly. Taking critical phenomenology as the guiding methodology, we foreground the constitutive significance that lived experiences of marginalisation, exclusion, social identity, conflict, ambiguity, and asymmetry have on experiencing ourselves as part of a We. How does the recent critical turn in phenomenology support, extend, qualify, or challenge phenomenological analyses of sociality? How can phenomenological descriptions of social phenomena point out pathways for social and political transformation and change? A critical phenomenology of the We investigates the question of “who are we?” as socially situated, historically contextualised, and culturally specific subjects.</p>
<p>We encourage original submissions on the theme Critical Phenomenology of the We which critically engage with themes found within both classical and contemporary phenomenological discussions of the We. We particularly encourage submissions that speak to one (or more) of the following lines of inquiry:</p>
<p>(1) For one, we are looking for contributions that take a clear starting point in lived experiences and real-life cases. Possible themes for such inquiries are, but not limited to, the ways in which group identity informs, obscures, and motivates acts of discrimination, normalisation, and oppression; how feelings of belonging and community are manufactured for exploitative ends, the role of collective memory and collective imagination for marginalised and historically oppressed groups; how narratives are collectively constructed to both hide and bring to light past and present injustices and their complex temporality.</p>
<p>(2) We also welcome papers that critically engage with classical and contemporary debates on the 'we'. How might we challenge and contest the valuing of community over society we find in Husserl, Walther, and Stein? How has the paradigm of European culture shaped the debate and how might we look beyond it? Do phenomenological analyses of second person engagement overlook the constitutive significance of the third person?</p>
<p>(3) Finally, we are interested in contributions that show the relevance of analyses from early 20th century phenomenology for contemporary debates within the philosophy of sociality. Besides the likes of Merleau-Ponty, Fanon, Beauvoir, and Sartre, how can the likes of Edith Stein, Gerda Walther, Max Scheler, and Aron Gurwitsch enrich recent more political engagements with the phenomenological method? In what sense can the  homeworld/alienworld distinction in Husserl’s generative phenomenology help us make sense of concrete intergroup dynamics?</p>
<p>With these themes in mind, a (non-exhaustive) list of possible topics to be examined under a phenomenological lens is:</p>
<p>·        The We of political movements, protest, and resistance</p>
<p>·        Group, collective and social identities</p>
<p>·        Group antagonisms and modes of domination</p>
<p>·        Inter- and intragroup relations of solidarity and care</p>
<p>·        The role of the 'Them' or the 'Third in the constitution of the 'We'</p>
<p>·        Asymmetrical reciprocity, empathy, and language breakdowns</p>
<p>·        Critiques of the relation between familiarity and strangeness</p>
<p>·        Feelings of (non-)belonging</p>
<p>·        Collective imagination and memory</p>
<p>·        Shared narratives of political, cultural, and transgenerational communities</p>
<p>·        National and transnational identities in classical and contemporary phenomenology</p>
<p>·        Questioning the We of philosophy and academia</p>

			<title>[ July 25, 2024 -  July 27, 2024] Conference or similar: 29th Conference of the Friedrich Nietzsche Society</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/116609</link>
						<description>Venue: Lungadige Porta Vittoria, 17<br/><br/><p><strong>29th Conference of the Friedrich Nietzsche Society </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Nietzsche in the Anthropocene</em></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>University of Verona, 25–27 July 2024</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hosted by Laura Langone and Carlo Chiurco</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Call for abstracts:</strong></p>
<p>Western civilization has maintained an ambiguous relation with nature. The Greeks saw it as <em>physis</em>, everything that possesses in itself the principle of movement, so that nature, in turn, showed  a paradigmatic value (in ethics, for instance). Nature, according to Aristotle (<em>Eth. Nic.</em> 1153b), is the force that, by its own virtue, makes each being “something divine”. <em>Physis</em>, in Karl Jasper’s reading, was also the <em>periéchon</em> – not simply the “habitat” of living beings, but what embraces every being.</p>
<p>Especially in the past two centuries, however, the industrial revolution has degraded nature as a mere object to serve human purposes, deemed far superior to those of other living beings. Humanity’s ruthless and careless exploitation of nature has brought the entire biosphere to the brink of catastrophe. We must urgently modify our behaviour towards nature to mitigate the long-established effects of the anthropogenic changes, such as species’ mass extinction and climate change, and find our lost place in nature.</p>
<p>In this respect, Nietzsche’s philosophy appears to be particularly insightful for addressing this task. Although Nietzsche was aware of nature’s absolute cruelty and immorality (HH I 223, GS 344), he nonetheless invited us to “translate humanity back into nature” (BGE 230), thus rejecting any metaphysical world beyond the Earth among others. </p>
<p>By drawing inspiration from culturally revolutionary movements of the 19th century (e.g. Goethe and Emerson) and the challenge brought about by science (Darwin), Nietzsche stood against the blind utilitarianism of his time as well as the anthropocentrism embedded in much of Western civilisation.</p>
<p>In the light of this, how can Nietzsche’s philosophy inform the approaches we should adopt towards the Anthropocene? To what extent does Nietzsche’s revaluation of all values allow for new ethical stances towards nature and the human body?  How could and should our relations to animals and the environment possibly be reinvented?</p>
<p>Possible topics for papers can include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nietzsche and Anthropocene studies.</li>
<li>Nietzsche and animal/environmental ethics.</li>
<li>What does Nietzsche mean by “nature” (including the relation between it and individual beings), and what does it entail to “translate humanity back into nature”?</li>
<li>The will to power as a philosophy of nature.</li>
<li>The significance of our animal origins and the relationship between the animal and the overhuman.</li>
<li>Nietzsche’s relationship to his contemporary natural science including evolutionary thought.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nietzsche and the history of the concepts of nature in Western philosophy, from ancient Greeks’ physicism to 19th-century German <em>Naturphilosophie.</em></li>
<li>Nietzsche and post/trans-nature: possibilities and dangers of the biotechnological revolution applied onto humans, animals, and plants.</li>
<li>To what extent can Nietzsche be considered a global thinker helping us imagining a different future?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>29esima Conferenza della Friedrich Nietzsche Society </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Nietzsche nell’Antropocene</em></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Università di Verona, 25-26-27 luglio 2024</strong></p>
<p><strong>Organizzata da Laura Langone e Carlo Chiurco</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Call for abstracts:</strong></p>
<p>La civiltà occidentale ha mantenuto un rapporto ambiguo con la natura. Agli occhi degli antichi Greci essa era <em>physis</em>, ciò che ha in sé il principio del movimento, e possedeva un valore paradigmatico (ad esempio in etica), tanto che, per Aristotele (<em>Eth. Nic.</em> 1153b) «tutto per natura ha un che di divino». <em>Physis</em>, nell’interpretazione di Karl Jasper, era anche il <em>periéchon</em> – non semplicemente l'<em>habitat</em> degli esseri viventi, ma il Tutto avvolgente che circonda ogni cosa.</p>
<p>Negli ultimi due secoli la rivoluzione industriale ha degradato il mondo naturale a un mero oggetto da sfruttare a piacimento, finendo col portare l'intero ecosistema sull'orlo del baratro. È tempo di agire: dobbiamo modificare urgentemente il nostro comportamento nei confronti della natura al fine di attenuare gli effetti a lungo termine dell'Antropocene, come l'estinzione di massa delle specie e i cambiamenti climatici, e ritrovare il nostro posto perduto nella natura.</p>
<p>La filosofia di Nietzsche appare uno strumento prezioso per affrontare questo compito. Nonostante Nietzsche a volte parli della crudeltà e immoralità della natura (UTU I 223, GS 344), egli tuttavia ci ha invitato a «ritradurre l'umanità nella natura» (ABM 230), tra l’altro negando le pretese metafisiche di un mondo eterno ed immutabile al di là di quello terreno.</p>
<p>Traendo ispirazione dalle rivoluzioni culturali del XIX secolo (ad esempio Goethe ed Emerson) e le sfide introdotte dalla scienza (Darwin), Nietzsche ha sfidato la visione della natura tipica dell'utilitarismo cieco del suo tempo e l'antropocentrismo radicato in gran parte della civiltà occidentale. </p>
<p>Alla luce di ciò, cosa ha da dire Nietzsche sull'Antropocene? In che misura la sua filosofia può ispirare le risposte che dovremo mettere in campo per affrontare le sfide dell’Antropocene? In che modo la trasvalutazione di tutti i valori può condurre a nuovi approcci etici nei confronti della natura e del corpo umano? Come potremmo ripensare le nostre interazioni con gli animali e l'ambiente a partire dalla filosofia di Nietzsche? </p>
<p>Argomenti possibili:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nietzsche e gli Antropocene studies.</li>
<li>Nietzsche e l’etica animale/l’etica ambientale.</li>
<li>Cosa intende Nietzsche per «natura» (inclusa la sua relazione coi viventi), e cosa vuol dire con l’espressione <a name="_Hlk148981365">«</a>ritradurre l'umanità nella natura<a name="_Hlk148981375">»</a>? </li>
<li>La volontà di potenza come filosofia della natura.</li>
<li>Il significato delle nostre origini animali e del rapporto tra gli animali e l'oltreumano.</li>
<li>Il rapporto di Nietzsche con le scienze naturali a lui contemporanee, inclusa la teoria dell'evoluzione.</li>
<li>Nietzsche e la storia dei concetti di natura nella filosofia occidentale, dall'antica fisica greca alla <em>Naturphilosophie </em>tedesca del XIX secolo.</li>
<li>Nietzsche e la post/trans-natura: possibilità e pericoli della rivoluzione biotecnologica applicata a esseri umani, animali e piante.</li>
<li>In che misura Nietzsche può essere considerato un pensatore globale capace di farci immaginare un futuro diverso?</li>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the inaugural issue of <em><a href="https://www.biblicaljournal.org/">Studies of Biblical Interest</a></em> (SBI) is now inviting submissions. SBI strives to foster an environment of open and pluralistic inquiry through articles related to comparative biblical studies, textual criticism, etymological research, archaeology, anthropology, religion and science, the study of religious and cultural texts worldwide, alternative readings, discussions, critiques, and reviews. We also reserve space in each issue for items that would not traditionally be published in an academic journal, including art, literary fiction, music, opinion pieces, photography, and poetry.</p>
<p>In biblical studies, opinions too often harden into dogmatic positions, which stifles scholarship. SBI endeavors to represent voices from across the field and beyond, regardless of whether their theories and views are in harmony with one another.</p>
<p>SBI publishes a biannual journal authored by students and scholars – academic and independent – espousing new and creative biblical ideas. We are especially interested in “back catalogues” of unpublished works. We welcome you to submit articles to <a href="mailto:editors@biblicaljournal.org">editors@biblicaljournal.org</a> per <a href="https://www.biblicaljournal.org/#submit-an-article">SBI guidelines</a> and please feel free to circulate this call to anyone you may think interested.<br/> <br/>We look forward to partnering with you in the search for greater understanding of one of the world’s foundational texts.<br/> <br/>Roger D. Isaacs (Member, Oriental Institute Advisory Council, University of Chicago)<br/>Adam R. Hemmings (Fellow, Royal Asiatic Society)<br/>Janice Williams Miller (The Publishing Institute)<br/><em>Founding Editors</em><br/><em>Studies of Biblical Interest</em><br/><a href="https://www.biblicaljournal.org/">https://www.biblicaljournal.org/</a></p>

Spiritualism was a wildly popular religious practice that burst onto the American scene in 1848 when two young girls in Hydesville, New York, claimed to be communicating with the dead. Within months, the movement spread from the Burned-Over District to the rest of the country, where, prompted by the cacophony of spirit voices suddenly audible to them, Spiritualist practitioners produced an enormous number and variety of publications, including transcriptions of séances and trance lectures; instruction manuals for reaching the dead; novels, short stories, and poems dictated by or devoted to the spirits; and newspapers delivering weekly and monthly news from the spirit realm. Even for those indifferent or opposed to the movement, its cultural ubiquity was impossible to ignore and its disruptive tendencies spawned debates around theology, gender, labor, domesticity, sexuality, and nearly every species of political, legal, and economic reform.  </p>
<p>In 1989, the religious historian Ann Braude persuasively (and groundbreakingly) argued that female mediums and trance lecturers contributed significantly to antebellum political debates surrounding women's rights, abolition, and temperance. In her wake, scholars of religion have continued to excavate Spiritualism's cultural importance in the nineteenth century and since, but literary critics and historians have lagged in their attention to Spiritualism's creative aspects and outputs—particularly those by women writers. Literary histories of the Spiritualist movement have often centered texts by male writers who ridiculed its association with women's rights, “free love,” and other feminist reforms. Important studies of the ghost story and the gothic novel have occluded Spiritualist writing or secularized its specifically religious elements. Studies of women's writing have overemphasized single texts (particularly Elizabeth Stuart Phelps's <em>The Gates Ajar</em>) and obscured the wider field. </p>
<p>This special issue seeks to build a more complete picture of Spiritualism as it informed or infused the lives and work of American women writers, and in particular to move beyond portraits of Spiritualism as an exclusively middle-class and white phenomenon. We invite contributions that address works by, about, or for Spiritualists, in any genre or form: novels, stories, sketches, chronicles, reports, letters, tracts, poetry, and more. We especially welcome essays or features about the Spiritualist activities of Black, indigenous, and other minoritized women (such as Rebecca Cox Jackson, Harriet Wilson, Sojourner Truth, and Elizabeth Keckley) and those that attend to the classed, gendered, and raced dynamics of Spiritualist practice and publication. And since much Spiritualist writing is not credited to a living woman at all but to a spirit speaking through her, and since women edited or co-edited at least 25% of all Spiritualist periodicals in the half-century after Hydesville, we seek essays that interrogate how Spiritualist involvement expanded notions of authorship and agency for women writers and/or how attention to women's Spiritualist writing might transform our own critical practices. </p>
<p>Possible essay topics include, but are by no means limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mediumship as imaginative, authorial, rhetorical, and/or linguistic practice</li>
<li>Spiritualism and/as fiction: mediumship as fiction writing, Spiritualists as subjects for fiction, or Spiritualism's relationship to ideas of fictionality</li>
<li>Spiritualism, sexuality, and gender identity in the séance room and beyond</li>
<li>Women writers and editors in the Spiritualist press</li>
<li>Race and its implications in and for Spiritualist practice and writing </li>
<li>Spiritualism as site for women's labor and professional achievement</li>
<li>Spiritualism and disability </li>
<li>Spiritualism and indigenous (North American and African) religious practices</li>
<li>Trans- or circum-Atlantic Spiritualist networks</li>
<li>Spiritualism and/as organized religion, including its relationship to or entanglement with non-Christian religions</li>
<li>Black and Indigenous women Spiritualists, their networks and communities</li>
<li>Spiritualism and social, political, cultural, and religious reform</li>
<li>Fore- and afterlives of Spiritualism, from late-eighteenth-century mesmerism to twentieth-century New Age religion to the contemporary Spiritualist Association of Churches</li>
</ul>
<p>Deadline: Completed papers must be submitted by August 1, 2024. Length limit: 10,000 words (including endnotes and list of works cited) using MLA format. Send electronic copies of papers to the special issue's guest editor, Ashley Reed (<a href="mailto:akreed@vt.edu">akreed@vt.edu</a>). </p>
<p>In addition to articles, the guest editor also welcomes proposals for <em>Legacy</em>'s feature sections: Profiles, Reprints, From the Archives, and On Culture.

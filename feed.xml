			<title>[ November 17, 2023 -  November 19, 2023] Conference or similar: Performance: 10th Annual International Conference of the Centre for Phenomenology in South Africa</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/111061</link>
						<description>Venue: University of Johannesburg<br/><br/><p>The conference aims to explore the role of performance in philosophy, psychoanalysis, and the arts, and to examine its relevance in contemporary thought.  </p>

<p>Performance can be viewed in various ways, including in terms of the distinction, common to French authors in the 1960s, between the enunciated statement and the act of enunciation or speech act. This concept is central to the work of Foucault’s archeology, Lacan’s post-structuralist rehabilitation of the psychoanalytic tradition, and feminist theory, especially the work on performativity by Judith Butler and other fourth wave feminist theorists. Performance is also an enduring and crucial topic in dance and theatre studies. In addition, it has attracted significant attention in the philosophy of education.   </p>

<p>This conference will address various topics related to performance, such as the links between performance and gender studies, performance and the unconscious, performance and the body in dance and theatre, and the therapeutic value of performance. It will explore questions like how performance helps to account for the shift from structuralism to post-structuralism, and how performativity constitutes a sufficiently plastic concept in feminist theory. </p></description>

			<title>[ July 27, 2023 -  August 3, 2023] Conference or similar: Experiencing Liminal Spaces in Feminist Philosophy - Nordic Summer University</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/111085</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>How to act from a place of not-knowing? Can we take ourselves seriously while not relying on the categories of thought that have repressed and excluded ‘others’? How can we learn to listen to what we don’t already know? These are questions that need to be addressed by feminist philosophy, in order to open up space within an otherwise fixed reality. We question the rigidity of language, of subject-object relations. Instead, we want to ask what is needed to think ‘thinking’ again? What happens when I relate to a(n) (m)Other? What does this othering accomplish, besides reaffirming the concepts of subject and object? Is there a way to be with what is not-me? Can we build bridges to relate to others that will enable us to be in liminal spaces? If we can, would that mean inventing impossible ways to relate that put in question what is knowledge, language, empathy, compassion? How to be present in a place that cannot be named? How to understand, and stay with what Derrida called the impossibility of witnessing what we ourselves survive?</p>
<p>“How is it possible that an event is, and is not? How can any event, properly called, be nothing? And yet… (...) the nature of miscarriage in (...) society. It both is and is not. It is both a source of acknowledged pain and suffering, and one swept easily away with ‘you can always try again’ or ‘it could be worse’.”</p>
<p>Derrida pointed at the “disturbing complicity between fiction and testimony”. Is this why there are so many contemporary speculative fictional accounts of motherhood and pregnancy, because there is no other way to address that particular liminal space? Is this what Hannah Arendt meant when she wrote: “The less we are free to decide who we are or to live as we like, the more we try to put up a front, to hide the facts, and to play roles.”</p>
<p>At the core of this seminar is an invitation to experience the liminal space of the in-between. “Liminal space is a place of ambiguity and anxiety, of no-longer and not-yet”, according to Ronald Carson. It is also a matrixial borderspace, and a witnessing of what cannot be witnessed. A liminal space is something that can emerge between me and you, between me and the world, and between me and myself. How to witness it? How to think it? How to write it? And how to investigate this together?</p>
<p>We especially invite workshops and shared practices to experience these liminal spaces, through listening, writing, being, investigating, thinking together. We look forward to taking the time together to stay with the anxiety of the ambiguity of a liminal space, a threshold that is not taking a position - yet. </p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>About the NSU Summer Session</p>
<p>One week long seminar in a space shared with eight other study circles investigating topics ranging from whiteness to Nordic environmental ethics, from ‘Racialisation, Objectification, Dehumanisation: Missionary and Merchant in the Mongolian Empire’ to ‘What a waste: surplus art, theory and tékhnē’. While we will host our own program during the week, and investigate the liminal space through philosophical workshops organised by the coordinators and participants alike, we will also be able to actively search out collaboration with and join the program of other circles present during the NSU Summer Session. </p>
<p>Please be aware that Nordic Summer University is a horizontal organisation fully run by volunteers and with minimum funding. During the NSU Summer Session members are invited to join the General Assembly to discuss and take decisions regarding the future (study) program of NSU. </p>
<p>Registration and fee</p>

In June 1957, when the founding/merging leaders of the new United Church of Christ processed through Cleveland, representation of the Afro-Christian Convention churches was folded into the representation of the Convention of the South—a 1950s initiative of the Congregational Christian denomination to fold Black churches of the South into a single conference.</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>But the spirit, worldview, worship, and impact of Afro-Christian Convention churches are not appropriately represented under the banner of the Congregational stream of UCC history, a stream informed predominantly by white perspective.

			<title>[ June 14, 2023] Conference or similar: Hyperdigital Designs</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/111009</link>
						<description>Venue: Alison Richards Building, 7 West Road (Sidgwick Site)<br/><br/><p>Digital technologies have become a deeply integrated aspect of our lives. From speaking to friends and ordering food to finding our way around, all our daily acts are now mediated by the digital. This deep integration promises to expand our agency, yet it also shapes and constrains it in ways that we may not recognise or welcome. Increasingly, we are confronted with a dilemma: either to withdraw from or engage with the use of digital technologies, as these often tend to disperse our attention and hinder our self-awareness. In the space of possibilities between anti-technological suspicions and anti-human desires for assimilation, we aim to critically reflect on the creative origins and free use of the cybernetic grammar of digital computers.</p>
<p>The ‘Hyperdigital Designs’ workshop at the University of Cambridge will explore creative reflections upon the grammar of digital computers. Building upon the collaborative ‘How to Play with Fire’ project that began at the 2022 Diverse Intelligence Summer Institute, the ‘Hyperdigital’ announces a higher reflection on the creation and use of digital media for human freedom. Beyond the fixed opposition between the Postdigital and the Digital, the Hyperdigital exceeds so as more radically to enter and accelerate the free use of the digital — whether among the creators of digital systems, or from the oldest creator of the idea of the digital itself.</p>
<p>We invite abstracts of up to 250 words for a one-day workshop on Wednesday 14 June 2023 at the University of Cambridge, Alison Richards Building SG2, hosted by Cambridge Digital Humanities and co-sponsored by the William Temple Foundation, to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on thinking beyond the digital at its highest point. We are interested to host talks that explore the fundamental theoretical questions of philosophy, theology, ethics, and art, as well as applied and practical discussions concerning how technologies or designs, from video games to generative artificial intelligence, can be envisioned to mediate and emancipate human creativity.</p>
<p>Send abstracts 250 words or less to HyperdigitalDesigns@gmail.com</p>
<p>Deadline for abstracts: Saturday 13 May 2023</p>
<p>Notice: Monday 15 May 2023</p>

Tracing but also challenging such a narrative of technological change and obsolescence, this workshop investigates the possibilities and limitations of transparency in all its material instantiations, and from perspectives both transhistorical and theoretical. Case studies include gauze, celluloid, varnish, openwork caskets, optical lenses, polaroid film, mordants, and witch balls. Taking these examples as starting points for wide-ranging discussion, we will think together about how the physical properties of a clear substrate, glaze, or surface might prompt reflection on concepts such as in/visibility, opacity, transcendency, distortion, obstinancy (<em>Eigensinn</em>), racialization, disclosure, and access.</p><p>Scheduled to coincide with the release of two important new books on transparency, <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/V/bo183106455.html" rel="nofollow"><em>The Varnish and the Glaze: Painting Splendor with Oil, 1100-1500</em></a> (Chicago, 2023), by Marjolijn Bol, and <em><a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300237245/transparency/" rel="nofollow">Transparency: The Material History of an Idea</a></em> (Yale, 2023), by Daniel Jütte, this workshop engages with current scholarship in the history of art, science, architecture, religion, museology, and conservation. </p><p>Supported by eikones, the NOMIS Foundation, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.</p><p>-------</p><p>Program<strong> </strong></p><p>Location: Forum eikones, Rheinsprung 11, 4051 Basel</p><p>From 08:30 - Welcome - coffee in the foyer</p><p>09:00 - Ruth Ezra, Introduction</p><p>09:20 - Patrick Crowley, ‘The Wrong Side of Things’: Roman Reverse-Engraved Glass</p><p>10:00 - Manuela Beer, Difference in Transparency: Rock Crystal in Medieval Artefacts</p><p>10:40 - Coffee break</p><p>11:00 - Arne Leopold, Veiling the Gaze, Veiling the Material: Openwork Caskets and the Pretence of Transparency in the 13th Century</p><p>11:40 - Leena Crasemann, Veiling Space: Textiles’ Anti-matter</p><p>12:20 - Lunch break</p><p>13:20 - Elizabeth Rice Mattison, Acid, Water, Rust, and Process in Dürer’s Etchings</p><p>14:00 - Phillip Roberts, Richard Reeve and Alice Grove: A Night Language</p><p>14:40 - Coffee break</p><p>15:00 - Jennifer Y.

Ahmed, S. Shiraz Ali, and Daniyal Channa</span></h4><h6><span><strong>Department of Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures, University of California, Berkeley</strong></span></h6><p> </p><h5>Fresh waves of research on the postclassical Islamic East are reshaping the shores of South Asian and Islamic studies. Recovering from the long shadow of decline theories and narratives, the ongoing study of Muslim intellectual pursuits in the subcontinent is bringing to light a world far more dynamic than previously believed. The region appears better situated within transregional contexts, while offering unique intellectual trajectories with reverberations across a broader range of fields. This conference invites specialists to present research on Muslim intellectual history in Mughal South Asia within the following areas:</h5><ol><li><h5>Philosophy, Theology, and Science</h5></li><li><h5>Rhetoric, Law, and Scripturalist Disciplines</h5></li><li><h5>Islamo-Sanskrit Engagements</h5></li><li><h5>Socio-Intellectual History</h5></li></ol><h5>Despite great strides in the study of the social, political, and cultural institutions of early modern South Asia, these efforts are yet to be reconciled with parallel developments in the study of knowledge production across Persianate frontiers.  Meanwhile within history of ideas, we are only gradually overcoming the trappings of conventional accounts of intellectual life in the region, specifically the sweeping theses of intellectual marginality and decline grounded in dichotomies like canon vs. commentary, rationalism vs. mysticism/scripturalism, Arabic orthodoxy vs. Persian/Indian cosmopolitanism, and their projection onto the source material at face value, i.e., as exhaustive binaries that tend to obfuscate actual disciplinary frameworks, literary practice, and transmission of knowledge.  While there is growing consensus that the postclassical intellectual currents were longer lasting and more intricate than previously believed, the variegated details of this past pose new methodological challenges.</h5><h5>The conference invites current research on Muslim intellectual history in Mughal South Asia across areas like philosophy, theology, astronomy, rhetoric, jurisprudence, hadīth, tafsīr, Perso-Sanskrit interactions, infrastructures of knowledge production. The event will be hosted at U.C. Berkeley on October 6-7, 2023, with travel and accommodation covered for visiting participants.  Abstracts must be received by June 23.  Selected applicants will be notified by July 7.  Each participant will have 45 minutes to present (including Q&amp;A).  The final articles will be published as a special issue or volume edited by the organizers.  The submission deadline for articles is March 15, 2024.</h5><ul><li><h5>The conference will be held on <b>October 6-7, 2023 </b>at the University of California, Berkeley.</h5></li><li><h5>Abstracts of 300-400 words must be sent to <b><a href="mailto:ali_syed@berkeley.edu">ali_syed@berkeley.edu</a></b> no later than <b>June 23, 2023</b>.</h5></li><li><h5>The deadline for complete articles is <b>March 15, 2024</b>.</h5></li><li><h5>Expenses for travel and accommodation will be covered for visiting participants.</h5></li></ul><h5>The event is sponsored by Berkeley's Center for Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures (CMES) and the Institute of South Asia Studies (ISAS)</h5><address> </address><address> </address></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Asad Q.

			<title>Call for Papers: &quot;Zero Hour: Rethinking 1945 from Jewish Transnational Perspectives” - An Interdisciplinary Workshop</title>

The immediate aftermath of the war and the Holocaust across the Atlantic gave rise to tectonic global changes. Some intellectuals questioned the future of humanity. Others called for a new humanism, for a “common cause” and the constitution of “one world” greater and more inclusive than the failed European tradition of nationalism. The publicly emerging details of the Holocaust added to the sense of profound rupture later expressed in Theodor Adorno’s famous epithet about the end of poetry after Auschwitz or Jean-Francois Lyotard’s declaration that Auschwitz is like an earthquake that destroyed the measuring instruments. Indeed, scholars often speak of <i>post</i>-Holocaust philosophy and theology, marking it as an event from which there is a clear separation of before and after. The goal of our workshop, however, is not to revisit the long trajectory of post-Holocaust thought, but to reconstruct overlooked continuities and sense of rupture in the Jewish (and general) intellectual atmosphere during the immediate aftermath—that is about the first decade—following 1945.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>The profound changes were not limited to the European scene. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the war also in the Pacific, while raising urgent questions about the meaning of technology and the possibility of the human to initiate global destruction. The Cold War brought with it a world under the sway of two superpowers. At the same time, the emergence of the United Nations as a world-organization allowed thinkers to imagine new world-constellations and helped give rise to the discourse of human rights. In the Jewish context, the founding of the State of Israel in 1948 brought with it a promise and many challenges.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>What kind of philosophies, or theologies, informed the immediate postwar constellation? How were past and present interpreted by historians or political thinkers? What futures were envisioned and a time of radical change? How was the turning point of 1945 theorized through the perspectives of flight and refuge?</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Our workshop will bring together scholars to think about 1945 and its immediate aftermath through a transnational lens of the Jewish experience. Its focus will be on voices—philosophical, theological, theoretical, or personal—reflecting on the Jewish condition at the end of the war and the beginning of a new era. This approach allows us to explore the interchange of ideas across multiple spaces and travel itineraries. We contend that such a perspective, which in this form has rarely been emphasized in the study of modern Jewish thought, can offer more complexity and nuance to the idea of a <i>Stunde null</i> in Jewish philosophy and theology by showing the extent to which thinkers navigated multiple international contexts before, during, and after the Holocaust and World War II. The focus on an epochal “watershed” also allows us to reflect more broadly on how intellectuals have grappled with historical discontinuities, turning points, and ideas of return and restoration.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><b><span>Some of the questions this workshop will ask: </span></b></span></span></span></p><ol><li><span><span><span><span>What kind of intellectual networks—Jewish and non-Jewish—developed in the immediate postwar era?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>What continuities exist between pre- and post-Holocaust thought?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>How was the atomic bomb theorized by Jewish and non-Jewish thinkers across continents?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>How did the emergent Cold War context shape Jewish thought? </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Are there new historiographies that emerge in this period as a result of the World War and the Holocaust?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>In what way do itineraries of Jewish thinkers change the way we think about Jewish thought as often focused on the nation-state or linguistic commonality (such as German-Jewish thought)?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>What accounts for the emerging interest in the post-1945 era today?</span></span></span></span></li></ol><p><span><span><span><b><span>Some of the figures of Jewish background we might discuss: </span></b></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Hannah Arendt, Raymond Aron, Leo Baeck, Eliezer Berkovitz, Ernst Bloch, Martin Buber, Ernst Cassirer, Arthur Cohen, Lucy Dawidowicz, Isaac Deutscher, Emil Fackenheim, Erich Fromm, Nahum Glatzer, Abraham J.

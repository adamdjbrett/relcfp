<p align="center"><strong>Harmony and Chaos: The Dialectics of Order and Disorder</strong></p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">Publication Date: December 2024 (Issue No. 52)</p>
<p align="center">Submission Deadline: March 31, 2024</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><em>The journal is pleased to collaborate with The Seventeenth International Conference of the Taiwan Association of Classical, Medieval and Renaissance Studies (TACMRS) and publish a feature topic on the theme of their October 2023 conference. Submissions from scholars not participating in the conference are also welcome. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The ideas of order and disorder are universal conceptual categories found across diverse disciplines and cultures. They often emerge as a pair of opposites that help humans characterize observed phenomena, experiences, and imagination. Changes in regimes, the development of societies, and the evolution of cultural trends, for instance, are sometimes comprehended through the filter of order and disorder. Representations in arts and literature may also be examined under pairs of similar attributes, such as symmetry and asymmetry, harmony and disharmony, unity and disunity, and so forth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is by no means an accident that the creation of the world is often conceived as a process of bringing formlessness into order, as can be found in creation myths in various cultures. Hesiod in <em>Theogony</em> and Plato in <em>Timaeus</em> both described the world as originating from chaos, the primordial condition of disorder. In Genesis, the earth was first “without form and void” upon creation (Genesis 1.1). God then brought divisions into the world—the divisions of light and darkness, Day and Night, the Sun and the Moon, the land and the seas, and vegetation and wildlife. The formless darkness was characterized as Chaos in Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>. The harmony of Eden—the established order created by God—crumbled after the Fall as Satan brought distrust, discord, and disgrace into the world. Moreover, the ancient Chinese divination text <em>I Ching</em> similarly denotes the formation of the world as a process of differentiation from the undivided mixture of original elements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The waxing and waning of order and disorder may also be found in works involving romantic relations, spiritual struggles, or political conflicts, either as explicit metaphors or underlying structures. In Donne’s “Elegy XIII,” the poet described the emotional turmoil generated at the loss of love as falling into the darkness of “old Chaos.” Similarly, Shakespeare’s Moor in <em>Othello</em> associated the dissolution of love with perdition and Chaos (<em>Othello</em> 3.3: 90–95). In <em>The Faerie Queene</em>, as the Redcrosse Knight was separated from Una under the deceptive schemes of Archimago and Duessa, he fell into a state of spiritual confusion and encountered a series of chaotic perils. Only by the rescue of Arthur and the help of Una (who symbolizes truth and unity) could the knight recover and finally attain holiness. In <em>The Tempest</em>, having escaped the political storm in his dukedom, Prospero established a new order on the formerly uncultivated island where untamed creatures and spirits like Caliban and Ariel resided. Apart from the above more well-known instances, numerous illustrations concerning the conflicts, interactions, and syntheses of order and disorder may be explored in different fields under different disciplines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This feature topic calls for research from scholars working in art history, literature, philosophy, history, geography, religious studies, cultural studies, classical studies, anthropology, social sciences, and beyond. We also welcome studies on the cultural dialogue between East and West. Topics for consideration might include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Explorations of cosmology, creation, or world views in relation to systems and/or chaos, entropy and/or negentropy, etc.</li>
<li>Analyses on art and visualization that involves symmetry, asymmetry, or elements concerning order and/or disorder</li>
<li>Explorations of musical compositions in terms of harmony and/or cacophony</li>
<li>Examinations on issues of religious doctrines, spirituality, heresy, or moral values with regard to unity and/or anarchy, moderation and/or excess, or other aspects in close relation to order and/or disorder</li>
<li>Critical interpretations of specific works addressing issues of concord and/or discord, <em>discordia concors</em>, or other related aspects  </li>
</ul>

Yet, simply because they are not the subject of multivolume biographies does not mean that “well-behaved” women did not have agency in their daily lives. This panel seeks to highlight the agentic force of the medieval women who did not subvert the patriarchal norms of their time. How did medieval women make use of patriarchal norms to their own advantage? Specifically, how did religious women, lay or monastic, live their own lives, create their own spaces, and make their own choices within the medieval patriarchal hegemony?</p>
<p>We encourage submissions which prioritize case studies of hitherto understudied women or women’s communities. While scholarship has deservedly noted the myriad ways in which figures such as Hildegard of Bingen or Eleanor of Aquitaine worked within patriarchal hierarchies, we seek to highlight those who have not yet received such attention. We recognize inherent biases of gender, social status, and education within many surviving medieval sources, and do not wish to limit topics for this session solely to sources written or used by women; rather, we also encourage papers on literary and historical sources which inform us about medieval women’s lives.</p>
<p>Submission is through the <a href="https://wmich.edu/medievalcongress/call">ICMS Confex site</a>, and the submission deadline is September 15, 2023. For more information, email <a href="mailto:acrafto2@nd.edu">acrafto2@nd.edu</a></p>

<p align="center">62.2 (October 2024)</p>
<p align="center">Nan Goodman, Editor in Chief<br/>Ruth Ellen Kocher and KP Kaszubowski, Guest Editors</p>
<p align="center">University of Colorado Boulder and Duke University Press</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p><strong>SCOPE:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>English Language Notes </em></strong>invites submissions for a special issue (October 2024) that will explore the dynamic nature of personhood as it relates to various notions of spirit and the afterlife. This interdisciplinary issue seeks to encourage discussions on empirical functionalism and ontological personalism of a person’s individuation, and the textural and palpable expressions of individuality. The editors are interested in how the construction of personhood considers the interaction of the material and immaterial, and how it is informed by the realm outside of the material in its ability to describe itself.</p>
<p>The issue aims to examine posthumous legacies through acts of archival and rhetorical deconstruction in all ways it may reverberate in society, culture, counter-culture, economics, politics, spirituality, and more. The editors also consider how the individual is shaped by cultural nostalgia, religious mythos, competing secular belief systems, and occult practices.</p>
<p>As scholars of rhetoric, the editors are interested in how language plays a part in developing the intersectional contexts of race, class, gender, and citizenship around spiritual, moral, and ethical foundations as it relates to the construction of personhood in spirit and body. This issue seeks to publish a wide variety of perspectives from various points of critical inquiry including scholarly and creative work / practice that expands our notions of the academic West. The issue also aims to explore the construction of personhood as both cultural precept and narrative surveillance in popular culture, media, film, art, and global literatures. We welcome contributions that discuss how artistic practice mirrors spiritual practice in the formation of personhood in times of cultural upheaval, and how personhood functions as civic, historical, and cultural afterlife.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TOPICS OF INTEREST:</strong></p>
<p>We invite scholarly and creative contributions from writers in all fields who engage the subject of personhood as a transdisciplinary trope through which we may consider questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the individual access the spiritual or immaterial realm for personal or creative development?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How does the concept of Afterlife shift in relation to the contemporary political, social, cultural, and private constructs? How do the prevailing concepts of Afterlife shape the individual?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How does the immaterial or spiritual inform medical or bodily care practices, and how do scientific and medical studies interact with the spiritual in generartive ways?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How does the construction of personhood function as both cultural precept and narrative surveillance in popular culture, media, film, art, and global literatures? In what ways does artistic practice mirror spiritual practice in the formation of personhood in times of cultural upheaval? How does personhood function as civic, historical, and cultural afterlife. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In what capacity can humanist discourse accommodate notions of pre-life personhood and identity as antecedent to the body despite naturalist and cognitive definitions of personhood which privilege consciousness and cognition?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How might digital personhood, biotechnology, and the expansion of nonhuman and posthuman agency reshape both spiritual and secular understandings of longevity and afterlife?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SUBMISSION:</strong> </p>
<p>Submissions may include essays, scholarly-adjacent critical essays, lyric essays, poetry, and genre-fluid texts that take an innovative approach to developing the creative artifacts. <strong>Interested authors should feel free to contact the guest editors: Ruth Ellen Kocher at <a href="mailto:ruthellen.kocher@colorado.edu">ruthellen.kocher@colorado.edu</a> and KP Kaszubowski at <a href="mailto:kpkaszu@gmail.com">kpkaszu@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Potential contributors may submit abstracts by September 1, 2023 or submit a completed article, essay, or creative piece by September 21, 2023</strong>. While the editors invite standard-length, single-author academic articles, we are open to other methods of critical inquiry and creative expression related to the issue’s theme: position papers, clusters, roundtable discussions, interviews, dialogues, and so on.</p>
<p>Essays will undergo peer review. All submissions should adhere to Chicago-style citations, notes and bibliography system. Work should be uploaded to our <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/dup-eln">submission portal here</a>: <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/dup-eln">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/dup-eln</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT DATES:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Submission Deadline: </strong>September 21, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Notification: </strong>November 30, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Publication Date: </strong>October 2024</p>

In keeping with the general call, the Religion and Literature permanent section invites proposals that examine how authors interrogate institutionalized systems of belief. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those aspiring to be on the panel should feel empowered to offer proposals that interpret the concept of religion rather loosely by potentially including the academy as an institution of belief. Maintaining a broad interpretation of religion to include all intersections of faith, folklore, belief, and literature, expressions of belief may include creeds, mottos, mission statements, the constitution, charters, manifestos, doctrines, etc. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Priority will be given to papers that call attention to how issues of belief–whether academic, religious, and/or secular–are often built upon internal systems of faith or “Truths.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please send 250-word abstracts with title to Dr. Seth Johnson at <a href="mailto:swjohnson3@ua.edu">swjohnson3@ua.edu</a>, no later than April 15th, 2023.</p>

<p>Are you a conversion-therapy survivor and want to share your experience so that this debunked and dangerous practice doesn’t happen in the future? Individual stories are powerful and have much potential to personalize the often-misunderstood practice of conversion therapy.</p>
<p>Whether or not you have formal training in writing or storytelling, I want to hear from you! I am putting together an edited volume of stories about conversion therapy as told by survivors themselves.</p>
<p>Though I am interested in all compelling stories, I am particularly keen to receive submissions written by trans folx, POC, and Muslim and Jewish individuals. I am also interested in submissions by individuals who underwent conversion therapy in non-religious contexts. But again, <strong>any and all submissions will be seriously considered</strong>.</p>
<p>I am looking for stories that center on one or two specific moments of your time in conversion therapy, whether it be your time in one-on-one meetings with your conversion therapist; your experience in group conversion therapy; or a story about your time at a conversion therapy conference meeting (e.g., Exodus International). Rather than looking for a broad survey of <em>all</em> your experiences in conversion therapy, I am seeking stories that center in on this one or these two moments to really offer a sensuous, focused narrative. These stories are best told when you really paint a picture of a particular moment or moments, so ensure to include a fully fleshed-out portrait of what this moment or these two moments were like by including lots of details (it’s always good to engage your readers’ senses!). Of course, you can fit your story into your larger story (e.g., snippets from your childhood, the enduring effects of conversion therapy, where you are now, etc.), but the main thrust of your submission should focus on this one moment or two moments in conversion therapy.</p>
<p>Submissions should run approximately 2,000-3,000 words. I am aiming to have all stories submitted by July 15, 2023 (though this deadline could be flexible).</p>
<p>I’d be more than happy to answer any and all questions you may have. Please feel free to reach out to me by e-mail (<a href="mailto:lucas.fww@gmail.com">lucas.fww@gmail.com</a>).</p>
<p>Thank you so much for considering contributing—I very much look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>All the best,<br/>Lucas F. W. Wilson, PhD</p>

Likewise, economic realities can shape women’s religious experiences, beliefs, and communities, providing a source of both support and critique. Today, growing income inequality, the persistence of poverty, and declining social mobility leave wide room for religiously-affiliated social action and women’s religious voices. Join us for a conversation about women and the intersection of religion and socioeconomic inequality, the popular narrative of the “common good,” and economic justice for women as a means of strengthening faith-based communities. </p><p>Panelists:  </p><p>Rev. Pat Bumgardner, Senior Pastor, Metropolitan Community Church New York (MCCNY)</p><p>Rev. Jennifer Jones-Austin, CEO And Executive Director of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies (FPWA)      </p><p>Rev. Dr. Liz Theoharis, Co-Chair of the Poor People's Campaign and Director, Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice, Union Theological Seminary</p><p>Moderator:  Rev. Dr. Katharine Henderson, President Emerita, Auburn Theological Seminary</p><p>2:15-2:30pm  Break</p><p>2:30-3:30pm Challenging Tradition: Gender and Religious Leadership</p><p>Women’s ordination is only one piece of what constitutes women’s leadership in the world’s religions. Working within their traditions to make them more inclusive, women take on diverse leadership positions—from denominational leaders to biblical scholars to religious activists to spiritual teachers— that challenge gender norms and lead to greater diversity and commitment in their communities.. The women on this panel will discuss their gendered experiences of religious leadership, how the focus on ordination obscures the many less visible forms of women’s leadership in religious communities, and the process of breaking the “stained glass ceiling.”</p><p>Panelists: </p><p>Rev. Dr. Jacqui Lewis,  Senior Minister for Public Theology and Transformation, Middle Church</p><p>Rabbi Jill Jacobs, CEO for T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights</p><p>Ret. Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori, Former Bishop of Nevada, Former Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church (2006-2015)</p><p>Moderator: Dr. Ann Pellegrini, Professor of Performance Studies &amp; Social and Cultural Analysis, New York University</p><p>3:30-4:00 pm Break</p><p>4:00-5:00pm Keynote Conversation: Reproductive Justice After Dobbs</p><p>In the aftermath of the Dobbs v. Jackson’s Women’s Health Organization Supreme Court decision, one of the most pressing and divisive issues relating to religion and women’s rights today is reproductive justice. While most observers tend to associate religious faith with arguments against abortion, clergy and faith-based activists have also fought to increase access to reproductive care, from assisting women in their search for abortion care in the years preceding Roe v Wade to spearheading challenges in our post-Dobbes legal landscape. This keynote conversation will discuss the past, present, and future of the role of faith in the movement for reproductive justice</p><p>Panelists:</p><p>Rev. Latishia James “Rev. Pleasure”, Co-Director of Organizational Development, Spiritual Alliance of Communities for Reproductive Dignity (SACReD)</p><p>Andrea Salwen Kopel,  Executive Director, National Council of Jewish Women New York (NCJW NY)</p><p>Rev.

It will discuss the menorah as marking objects connected with priests; as creating a link with the Jerusalem Temple; as symbolising Jewish worship and hope; and as indicating a person’s “Jewishness”, similar to the role of the cross in Christian contexts.</p><p>Professor Lutz Doering has been Professor of New Testament and Ancient Judaism at the University of Muenster since 2014, where he also heads the Institutum Judaicum Delitzschianum. Before coming to Muenster, he taught at King’s College London and Durham University. His research focuses on the Dead Sea Scrolls and related texts, Jewish Apocalypticism, Hellenistic and Rabbinic Judaism, halakhah and festivals in ancient Judaism and their early Christian reception as well as letter writing and communication in ancient Judaism and Christianity.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><h3><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/institute-jewish-studies/" rel="nofollow">www.<b>ucl</b>.ac.uk › institute-jewish-studiesInstitute of Jewish Studies | UCL Institute of Jewish Studies </a></h3></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ijs@ucl.ac.uk">ijs@ucl.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/511805392707" target="_blank">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/511805392707</a></div></div></div></description>

As Iberia’s overseas jurisdictions and economic activities expanded, the intellectual equilibrium forged through many centuries of reconquista required radical reinvention.</p><p><a href="https://networks.h-net.org/salamanca.school">The School of Salamanca Project</a> is just one of many recent projects valorizing the fertile contribution of the Salamantine thinkers to a wide range of topics.

The latter are often subsumed under the rather problematic and open-ended rubric “Muslims.” This has resulted in numerous political and legal attempts to confront, categorise, and ultimately control internal Muslim communities, just as it has been used to keep external ones at bay. This Muslim Question, however, is often less about actual Muslims than it is about idealised and reified ones, what Professor Hughes calls “the ubiquitous Muslim,” someone who is imagined to threaten so-called Western values from within. In this lecture, Professor Hughes will address how this “ubiquitous Muslim” — everywhere yet nowhere, named but nameless, both unsettled and unsettling—subsequently aids in the recalibration of now politicised commitments to perceived founding ideals, such as liberty and equality.</p><p><strong>Speaker</strong></p><p><strong>Aaron Hughes</strong> is the Dean's Professor of the Humanities and Philip S. Bernstein Professor of Religion at the University of Rochester, USA. He is also Visiting Guest Professor at the Aga Khan University’s Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilisations (AKU-ISMC). Professor Hughes is the author of of numerous books on Islam and religion, including , most recently, An Anxious Inheritance Religious Others and the Shaping of Sunni Orthodoxy (Oxford University Press, 2022), From Seminary to University: An Institutional History of the Study of Religion in Canada (University of Toronto Press, 2020), Muslim and Jew: Origins, Growth, Resentment (Routledge, 2019), and Shared Identities: Medieval and Modern Imaginings of Judeo-Islam (Oxford University Press, 2017).

Individual stories are powerful and have much potential to personalize the often-misunderstood practice of conversion therapy.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Whether or not you have formal training in writing or storytelling, I want to hear from you! I am putting together an edited volume of stories about conversion therapy as told by survivors themselves.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Though I am interested in all compelling stories, I am particularly keen to receive submissions written by trans folx, POC, and Muslim and Jewish individuals. I am also interested in submissions by individuals who underwent conversion therapy in non-religious contexts. But again, <strong>any and all submissions will be seriously considered</strong>.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I am looking for stories that center on one or two specific moments of your time in conversion therapy, whether it be your time in one-on-one meetings with your conversion therapist; your experience in group conversion therapy; or a story about your time at a conversion therapy conference meeting (e.g., Exodus International). Rather than looking for a broad survey of <i>all</i> your experiences in conversion therapy, I am seeking stories that center in on this one or these two moments to really offer a sensuous, focused narrative. These stories are best told when you really paint a picture of a particular moment or moments, so ensure to include a fully fleshed-out portrait of what this moment or these two moments were like by including lots of details (it’s always good to engage your readers’ senses!). Of course, you can fit your story into your larger story (e.g., snippets from your childhood, the enduring effects of conversion therapy, where you are now, etc.), but the main thrust of your submission should focus on this one moment or two moments in conversion therapy.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Submissions should run approximately 2,000-3,000 words. I am aiming to have all stories submitted by July 15, 2023 (though this deadline could be flexible). </span></span></p><p><span><span>I’d be more than happy to answer any and all questions you may have. Please feel free to reach out to me by e-mail (<a href="mailto:lucas.fww@gmail.com">lucas.fww@gmail.com</a>).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Thank you so much for considering contributing—I very much look forward to hearing from you.</span></span></p><p><span><span>All the best,<br/>Lucas F.

In response, Taiwan’s indigenous people allied with the global indigenous rights movement and expanded their hunting rights in the 2005 Indigenous Peoples Basic Law. Taiwan’s indigenous people, including the Atayal hunters in this ethnography, contend that their traditional ecological knowledge sustains the balance of their local ecosystems, and many Atayal people point to the Buddhist release of life ceremony as a threat to ecological balance. Nicolaisen will argue that by seeking to substitute “equality of life” for “human equality,” LCA aims to liberate sentient beings from the constraints of liberal humanism, but in doing so, they also propagate Han colonial policies toward indigenous peoples. Yet, as the indigenous people ally with the indigenous rights movement and their Christian churches, they rely on the institutions of liberal humanism and Christianity to resist Han colonialism.</div><div><p><b>About the Speaker</b><br/>Jeffrey NICOLAISEN is currently a post-doctoral research fellow at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and Ca’ Foscari University of Venice.

<p>Conference 2023: Religious Experience and the Phenomenology of Nature</p>
<p>Hosted by the National University of Galway and St. Angela’s College, Sligo, 16th– 19th August 2023</p>
<p>Call for Abstracts/PapersThe Theme of the Conference</p>
<p>Faced as we are with climate change, mass extinctions of species, global pandemics, there is probably no more pressing theme today than that of nature. It is, however, not at all clear what we mean by ‘nature’, and whether discourse about nature is even meaningful today. Many speak of the ‘death of nature’ while at another extreme we find the exhortation toward a ‘re-enchantment’ of [by] nature. What the conference aims to explore is the place of religious experience within this our current situation.</p>
<p>Nature philosophy, including environmental ethics, but also the revival in Schellingian themes and the rediscovery within Phenomenology of the question of nature (Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Husserl), questions any unidirectional subject/object relation to nature. Nature is that in which we find ourselves as human beings and despite our molding of our environments, according to such a view, the human engagement with the world itself embodies nature. The emphasis on embodiment shows not alone the limits of dualisms, but also the commonality of the human with the natural world in which we are and breathe. The inter-subjective experience of such being in nature and the inter-corporeal being with animals and plants around us is reflected in the sacramentality of religious observance from totemic rituals to the Christian Eucharist.</p>
<p>Inspired by the overcoming of dualisms of body and mind and nature and freedom deriving from the Phenomenology and Schelling, we can re-examine the religious sense of nature as containing sacredness. This religious sense can be understood metaphysically as an intuition of reality appearing as unapproachable. Phenomenologically, the question as to the source of this sense of the inapproachable and sacred can be understood in terms of feelings of awe (e.g., Otto). Not alone can nature be a source or locus of religious experience, but it may also be the case that religious affectivity gives us access to nature beyond the objectifying and instrumentalizing tendencies of Modernity. In this respect, we can think of the phenomenologies of life (Bergson, Tymieniecka, Henry), which explore modes of appearance of nature beyond the dualities of mechanism and vitalism. These accounts draw on – explicitly or implicitly – religious motifs such Christian notion of life as Christ, Vedantic life as Sat (Truth of Being, identical with self-consciousness and fullness), or Islamic God as truth or reality (<em>al-Haqq</em>), as well as other concepts across many traditions which are connecting life and nature. These motifs can be understood as compatible with the growing movement of panpsychism in the philosophy of mind (Strawson, Goff, Chalmers, Nagel) and the philosophy of life in biology (Varela, Maturana, Wilson).</p>
<p>Living through a pandemic it is important to hear [here?] attend to the core meaning of the word – <em>pan demos</em>, concerning all the people. Just as nature is everywhere, so any discourse about dwelling in nature (eco-logy) must be seen to concern the totality of human experience, in the sense of the full richness of its diversity. One manner in which such diverse experience can be understood is the way in which nature is experienced as a temporal phenomenon. This is clear already in the experience of the cyclicality of the seasons. It is also manifest in the current sense of ecological crisis which draws on a religious sensibility that has remained present in different guises through Modernity, namely the eschatological. In attempting to think nature with respect to religious experience, we are thinking within the intersection of temporal strands: mortal time, conscious time, cyclical, indefinite time, eternal, creative ‘time’. Understood eschatologically or messianically this relation is one in which ending is woven into the fabric of time: time as ending, transforming of the past in the present and the opening up of a new future, time of forgiveness, repentance, grace and judgment (<em>kairos</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in thinking of nature from a specifically Christian standpoint, we are invariably drawn into the thought of Incarnation and Creation. The complexities of both terms indicate ambiguities in the articulation of nature within the religious experience. Understood as creation, nature can be understood as a domain of divine bounty to be valued and cared for <em>or</em> as an object to be mastered and exploited, while remaining a source of temptation away from the creator. The prohibition on idols emphasized the distance between divinity and nature, making questionable any source of religious experience within nature. The ambiguity here can be seen in the place of beauty which is sometimes affirmed within Medieval philosophy as a ‘transcendental’ (along with goodness, unity, truth), but is more often passed over, something which has been emphasized by such figures as Maritain and von Balthasar. Yet, if the Incarnation is taken seriously as a second creation, then the underlying motif is not power but self-emptying (<em>kenosis</em>) and understanding nature in terms of this event is to approach it in its materiality as touched by divine presence. Indeed, it is the Incarnation historically was instrumental in the modification of the prohibition on idols and the re-conceiving of the relation of image to divinity.</p>
<p>A more immanentist account of God and divinity, broadly speaking polytheistic, allows for a less ambivalent account of nature. The “world is full of gods” (Aeschylus) or at least there are domains of gods and spirits – sacred groves, forests, mountain tops – where human experience is confronted with nature as overwhelming, as powerful, as forbidding. Yet, in such accounts, there are ways towards the divine, through rituals of cleansing and purification or through ecstatic experiences of possession. Boundaries can be crossed while retaining a reverence for nature as that which has a being in and of itself, which is for the human only as a gift of its own bounty.</p>
<p>Pantheism and panentheism in understanding nature as pervaded by or identical with the divinity, speaks to an experience of participation with nature, which goes further towards a learned fusion with nature, where the full realization of the self is in its incorporation in the divine wholeness.</p>
<p>The experience of nature and divinity is reflected in divisions within society and politics. The manner in which the divinity is gendered or represented in racially specific ways and the manner conversely in which human beings are stratified in terms of their proximity to or distance from nature have been used and continue to be used to justify relations of oppression. The mastery of nature goes hand in hand with a mastery of nature within the self and of the mastery and servility of genders, races and classes.</p>

<p>Conference 2023: Religious Experience and the Phenomenology of Nature</p>
<p>Hosted by the National University of Galway and St. Angela’s College, Sligo, 16th– 19th August 2023</p>
<p>Call for Abstracts/PapersThe Theme of the Conference</p>
<p>Faced as we are with climate change, mass extinctions of species, global pandemics, there is probably no more pressing theme today than that of nature. It is, however, not at all clear what we mean by ‘nature’, and whether discourse about nature is even meaningful today. Many speak of the ‘death of nature’ while at another extreme we find the exhortation toward a ‘re-enchantment’ of [by] nature. What the conference aims to explore is the place of religious experience within this our current situation.</p>
<p>Nature philosophy, including environmental ethics, but also the revival in Schellingian themes and the rediscovery within Phenomenology of the question of nature (Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Husserl), questions any unidirectional subject/object relation to nature. Nature is that in which we find ourselves as human beings and despite our molding of our environments, according to such a view, the human engagement with the world itself embodies nature. The emphasis on embodiment shows not alone the limits of dualisms, but also the commonality of the human with the natural world in which we are and breathe. The inter-subjective experience of such being in nature and the inter-corporeal being with animals and plants around us is reflected in the sacramentality of religious observance from totemic rituals to the Christian Eucharist.</p>
<p>Inspired by the overcoming of dualisms of body and mind and nature and freedom deriving from the Phenomenology and Schelling, we can re-examine the religious sense of nature as containing sacredness. This religious sense can be understood metaphysically as an intuition of reality appearing as unapproachable. Phenomenologically, the question as to the source of this sense of the inapproachable and sacred can be understood in terms of feelings of awe (e.g., Otto). Not alone can nature be a source or locus of religious experience, but it may also be the case that religious affectivity gives us access to nature beyond the objectifying and instrumentalizing tendencies of Modernity. In this respect, we can think of the phenomenologies of life (Bergson, Tymieniecka, Henry), which explore modes of appearance of nature beyond the dualities of mechanism and vitalism. These accounts draw on – explicitly or implicitly – religious motifs such Christian notion of life as Christ, Vedantic life as Sat (Truth of Being, identical with self-consciousness and fullness), or Islamic God as truth or reality (<em>al-Haqq</em>), as well as other concepts across many traditions which are connecting life and nature. These motifs can be understood as compatible with the growing movement of panpsychism in the philosophy of mind (Strawson, Goff, Chalmers, Nagel) and the philosophy of life in biology (Varela, Maturana, Wilson).</p>
<p>Living through a pandemic it is important to hear [here?] attend to the core meaning of the word – <em>pan demos</em>, concerning all the people. Just as nature is everywhere, so any discourse about dwelling in nature (eco-logy) must be seen to concern the totality of human experience, in the sense of the full richness of its diversity. One manner in which such diverse experience can be understood is the way in which nature is experienced as a temporal phenomenon. This is clear already in the experience of the cyclicality of the seasons. It is also manifest in the current sense of ecological crisis which draws on a religious sensibility that has remained present in different guises through Modernity, namely the eschatological. In attempting to think nature with respect to religious experience, we are thinking within the intersection of temporal strands: mortal time, conscious time, cyclical, indefinite time, eternal, creative ‘time’. Understood eschatologically or messianically this relation is one in which ending is woven into the fabric of time: time as ending, transforming of the past in the present and the opening up of a new future, time of forgiveness, repentance, grace and judgment (<em>kairos</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in thinking of nature from a specifically Christian standpoint, we are invariably drawn into the thought of Incarnation and Creation. The complexities of both terms indicate ambiguities in the articulation of nature within the religious experience. Understood as creation, nature can be understood as a domain of divine bounty to be valued and cared for <em>or</em> as an object to be mastered and exploited, while remaining a source of temptation away from the creator. The prohibition on idols emphasized the distance between divinity and nature, making questionable any source of religious experience within nature. The ambiguity here can be seen in the place of beauty which is sometimes affirmed within Medieval philosophy as a ‘transcendental’ (along with goodness, unity, truth), but is more often passed over, something which has been emphasized by such figures as Maritain and von Balthasar. Yet, if the Incarnation is taken seriously as a second creation, then the underlying motif is not power but self-emptying (<em>kenosis</em>) and understanding nature in terms of this event is to approach it in its materiality as touched by divine presence. Indeed, it is the Incarnation historically was instrumental in the modification of the prohibition on idols and the re-conceiving of the relation of image to divinity.</p>
<p>A more immanentist account of God and divinity, broadly speaking polytheistic, allows for a less ambivalent account of nature. The “world is full of gods” (Aeschylus) or at least there are domains of gods and spirits – sacred groves, forests, mountain tops – where human experience is confronted with nature as overwhelming, as powerful, as forbidding. Yet, in such accounts, there are ways towards the divine, through rituals of cleansing and purification or through ecstatic experiences of possession. Boundaries can be crossed while retaining a reverence for nature as that which has a being in and of itself, which is for the human only as a gift of its own bounty.</p>
<p>Pantheism and panentheism in understanding nature as pervaded by or identical with the divinity, speaks to an experience of participation with nature, which goes further towards a learned fusion with nature, where the full realization of the self is in its incorporation in the divine wholeness.</p>
<p>The experience of nature and divinity is reflected in divisions within society and politics. The manner in which the divinity is gendered or represented in racially specific ways and the manner conversely in which human beings are stratified in terms of their proximity to or distance from nature have been used and continue to be used to justify relations of oppression. The mastery of nature goes hand in hand with a mastery of nature within the self and of the mastery and servility of genders, races and classes.</p>

In the textual traditions, temples have been perceived as Purush and Prakriti, both immutably depicting the cosmos. The connection with the divine, whether as an individual, group or community, is as personal as it is shared. Temples encapsulate this spirit by acting as sites of sacred space where the revered is the supreme and the devotee a participant in its grandeur. Historically temples have always had a central role to play in the normal functioning of society. Within the several hierarchies of temples being dedicated from Gram devta, Kul devta, Tirtha sthal to Dham, temples have served as public spaces with a binding factor. Therefore, it also gives rise to the material and non-material cultures around themselves.</p><p>The Indian Temple has been hailed as a ‘Monument of Manifestation’ by the eminent art historian Stella Kramrisch. This statement has not even a modicum of fiction in it. Hinduism certainly has a hoary history, and its antiquity could be traced back at least to the Rig Vedic Period. Yajña or the institution of sacrifice, was the core of the Vedic Religion. The Yajur Veda and the Brāhmaṇa texts contain mantras or sacrificial formulae and elaborate injunctions pertaining to the performance of Yajñas. These Vedic Yajñas would be conducted in specially constructed Vedic altars known as chitis. The construction of these chitis was an architectural science, and in their simplest forms, the chitis were a pile of bricks. As time advanced, there was marked shift from Yajñas to worship images in specially built enclosures or temples. However, despite the Yajña rituals gradually waning into the background, the structures of temples owe their origins to the Vedic chitis. The act of temple construction was considered equivalent to a Yajña and was to be initiated in strict confirmation of the prescribed set of rituals. The emergence and dissemination of Bhakti and the ever-growing prominence of sects like Bhāgavata and Śaiva added to the functional and spiritual relevance of temples. The Dharmaśāstra texts incorporated the building of temples in the category of Pūrta Dharmas, and a person belonging to any varṇa could undertake the tasks which were included in the Pūrta Dharma.</p><p>The Epics and Purāṇas comprise many references to temples, and those like the Agni and Matsya Purāṇas provide detailed instructions about the creation of temples and consecration of images in them. Moreover, texts specially dedicated to the science of temple building were written and widely used by the sthapatis. Speaking from an 3 archaeological perspective, the history of temples goes back to the Mauryan Period. We find a depiction of small shrines in the reliefs from the Buddhist Stupa sites of Bharhut and Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh and Mathurā. Epigraphical evidences from the Śuṅga Period onward also provide testimony to the construction of shrines which archaeological evidences have to a great extent corroborated. The structures of temples became more elaborate and codified from the Gupta Period onward. Apart from the Guptas, dynasties like the Vākāṭakas in central India and the Badami Cālukyas and Pallavas in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu respectively pioneered the creation of temples- both rock-cut and structural. During the Gupta period we find a systematic categorization of temples based on their shapes and dimensions. Around the same time, temple architecture manifested itself in three principal idioms- Nāgara, Draviḍa, and Vesara. Apart from these three major architectural styles, several regional styles of temple building originated and matured in various parts of India. From simple shrine like structures, temples now assumed colossal forms equipped with a garbhagṛha (sanctum sanctorum), a line of maṇḍapas or halls, massive śikharas, and shrines of parivāra devatas.</p><p>By the early medieval period, individual temples metamorphosed into temple complexes, and these temple complexes grew into the cultural hubs of contemporary society. It was mainly through the institution of temples that performing arts like music and dance, fine arts like sculpture and paintings, and culinary traditions of bhoga were inextricably connected. Temples no longer remained purely religious establishments- they took on multi-dimensional roles as educational, economic, social, and political epicentres shaping the aesthetic expression of the then societies. Many dynasties, merchants, and common people contributed munificently towards the construction of temples. Hinduism came to be almost completely identified with temples, and art historian George Michell has opined that the Hinduism that developed around the start of the 1st millennium CE is, to a great extent, ‘Temple Hinduism’. This statement aptly summarizes the vital position of temples in the gamut of Hinduism. The temples of India not merely evoke a profound veneration towards a deity through various ritual enactments and festivals but also have been subjected to a magnificent oeuvre of cultures when devotees throng its premises from parts of the country. They facilitate intercultural dialogue and circulate the idea of multiplicity of cultures with deeply rooted human values of shared experiences, respect, and togetherness.</p><p>The conference therefore, aims to bring together researchers from all disciplines to deliberate upon the philosophical, religious, social, economic, technical, artistic, ethnographic, traditional, landscape, material, and non-material aspects of temples.</p><p><strong>Broad Themes of the conference:</strong> The topics may include, but are not restricted to:  Art and Architecture of the temples</p><p> Temples as centres of learning: Textual Traditions of the temples</p><p> Economic and political patronage of the temples</p><p> Temple Pilgrimage, Ecology and the Environment</p><p> Urbanism and the Temples</p><p> Temples as Economic spaces</p><p> Temple Food culture: Bhoga &amp; Śṛṅgāra Paramparā</p><p> Rāga Paramparā : Musical traditions associated with the temples</p><p> Folklore and Oral narratives shaping the temple cultures</p><p> Conservation and Preservation of the temples</p><p> Mobility of the temples</p><p> Social justice: Caste, Untouchability, and access to temples</p><p> House temples and the idea of service</p><p> Temple without deities</p><p> Sampradāyas and the temples</p><p> Temple Festivals and feasts</p><p> Temples and the colonial state</p><p> Performative temple arts</p><p>A nominal amount of Rs. 800/- can be paid online or on arrival.

						<description>Publication Name: National Taiwan University Philosophical Review: Special Issue on Arguments in Philosophy of Religion<br/><br/><p><strong><em>National Taiwan University Philosophical Review</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Call for Paper for Special Issue on <em>Arguments in Philosophy of Religion</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Guest editors: Graham Oppy, Lok-Chi Chan</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>This special issue accepts original articles or commentaries on Graham Oppy's lead article, "Good Argument". Short commentaries on the lead article are welcome.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>I.             </strong><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Established in 1971, the <em>National Taiwan University Philosophical Review</em> is a peer-reviewed journal published by the department of philosophy at National Taiwan University ( http://review.philo.ntu.edu.tw/?hl=en ). This special issue on <em>Arguments in Philosophy of Religion </em>is co-organized by the journal<em> </em>and the Center for Traditional and Scientific Metaphysics (TSM) at National Taiwan University, and is originated from the latter’s <em>Analytic Philosophy of Religion in Asia</em> (APRA) project. The APRA project aims to promote the development of the Asian community of the analytic philosophy of religion and its connection with the rest of the globe, and it has organized multiple international conferences, seminar series, and publication projects.</p>
<p>The topic of religion has been debated extensively in analytic philosophy by believers and nonbelievers alike, such as Russell, Wittgenstein, Ayer, and their successors and opponents. But an important question in philosophy, especially analytic philosophy, is what really constitutes a genuine philosophical argument. Some possible relevant questions include (but are not exclusive to):</p>
<p>(a)  Why should we expect that an argument could convince a philosophical opponent or a neutral bystander, no matter how reasonable and sound it seems to ourselves?</p>
<p>(b)  What are the conditions that must be met by a convincing argument, especially when your targets have fundamental disagreements with your basic worldview and methodology?</p>
<p>(c)  Do the cosmological arguments, teleological arguments, arguments from evil, arguments from hiddenness, and the like, even if apparently sound, really work as intended?</p>
<p>(d)  Can we expect the success of any such argument? </p>
<p>(e)  Does the consideration of religion or the transcendent make the case special?</p>
<p>Several internationally renowned philosophers of religion were invited to contribute to this special issue.</p>
<p><strong><br/>II.            </strong><strong>Submission</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>1.    This special issue accepts <strong>English submissions</strong> only.</p>
<p>2.    This special issue accepts two kinds of submissions:<strong> <u>(a) original articles</u></strong> and <strong><u>(b) commentaries on Graham Oppy’s lead article</u></strong>.</p>
<p>3.    For Oppy’s lead article, ‘Good Argument’, see: <a href="https://reurl.cc/x9GXRV">https://reurl.cc/x9GXRV</a>  . If there are a sufficient number of commentaries, Graham Oppy will offer a response to commentators.</p>
<p>4.    The word limit is <strong><u>7000 words</u></strong>. <strong><u>Short commentaries on the lead article</u></strong> are welcome.</p>
<p>5.    Submission deadline: <strong><u>28 Feb 2023</u></strong>.</p>
<p>6.    Submissions should be sent in Microsoft Word format to <a href="mailto:ntuphilreview@gmail.com"><strong>ntuphilreview@gmail.com</strong></a><strong><u> and </u></strong><a href="mailto:tsmntu@gmail.com"><strong>tsmntu@gmail.com</strong></a><strong><u> , with the title ‘Submission to Arguments in Philosophy of Religion’.</u></strong></p>
<p>7.    Please send you submission along with a title, an abstract of 500 words, a maximum of 5 keywords, together with a separate document containing your name, brief CV, institute, position, address, phone number, and email.</p>
<p>8.    Apart from the instructions outlined above, any submission should in principle follow the regulations of a standard journal submission.</p>
<p>9.    If the submission number exceeds the possible slots of this CFP, the editorial board of the <em>NTU Philosophical Review</em> may assign a submitted article to another issue upon the author’s agreement.</p>
<p>10.For any questions, please contact Lok-Chi Chan at <a href="mailto:lokchan@ntu.edu.tw">lokchan@ntu.edu.tw</a></p>

The invitation is extended to all scholars on Alevis and Alevism<br/>who are interested in critically engaging with historiographies surrounding Alevi communities<br/>and the field of Alevi studies.<br/>The specific focus on historiography for this workshop directs our attention to accounts and<br/>narratives on (the) Alevi past(s) and relevant discussions on the role and function of these<br/>accounts. Such accounts of the past are shared and communicated within Alevi communities,<br/>between Alevi communities and in dialogue or opposition to various others – such as Sunni<br/>Muslims, Turkish state agencies, or scholars of Alevism. There may be questions of labelling,<br/>representation, visibility, authenticity, legitimation as well as material interests, such as the<br/>distribution of resources and access to social and political power involved in the creation and<br/>communication of such accounts of the past.<br/>Thus, we are looking for contributions that present new empirical material or novel researchbased<br/>perspectives on Alevi historiography and focus either on<br/>• historiography as the Alevi emic processes of understanding, negotiating and<br/>demarcating Alevi history, or<br/>• historiography as the academic study of the history of, and discourses on, Alevism<br/>and Alevi communities</p><p>If you are interested in presenting at the workshop, please send a 300-500 word abstract and<br/>a 150-word bio by November 8, 2022 to <a href="mailto:Hege.Markussen@ctr.lu.se">Hege.Markussen@ctr.lu.se</a>. Selections will be<br/>finalised by December 16, 2022 and the final deadline for submitting draft of the articles for<br/>the workshop is August 15, 2023.

Such events include the resurgence of Asian American hate since the pandemic, as well as the ongoing court case against affirmative action: “Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.” It is a mistake to assume, however, that Asians have been passive agents in these events. Many Asian Americans have taken part in activism—but have their voices been loud enough to be heard or have they been muffled amidst the magnitude of Asian American hate that renders racism against them invisible? Adding more layers to these issues is the way that the civil rights struggle creates solidarity within the Asian American community and other minoritized communities, but at the same time it has also fostered divisiveness both within Asian American communities and outside. How have ideas about immigration, stereotypes, and boundaries been both embraced and challenged by Asian Americans?</p><p>Needless to say, the problem of defending the civil rights of Asian Americans is a complex matter, one in which religion struggles to find its place. For this year’s conference, we ask what role religion holds in communicating and addressing these social and political issues? How do religious discourses, rituals, doctrines, and teachings serve Asian Americans in terms of defending their civil rights, as well as fostering group solidarity amidst the plurality of Asian American religious traditions? As scholars of Asian American religion, what is our role in this political discourse? How do we see Asian American civil rights movements and scholarship moving forward?</p><p>Scholars of all levels are invited to participate in this dialogue. Interested parties may send abstracts (250 words) to Shannon Toribio(<a href="mailto:shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu">shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu</a>) or Laura Snell (<a href="mailto:laurasnell@ucsb.edu">laurasnell@ucsb.edu</a>). The <strong>deadline</strong> for submission is<strong> October 14, 2022. </strong>All participants must submit a Program Participant Form (attached and also available on the AAR/WR website). Participants at AARWR must be members of the AAR. The AAR membership information is found at aarweb.org.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>shannon toribio</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu">shannon_toribio@ucsb.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

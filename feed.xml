A distinguished and decades-old - but still rather limited - field has undertaken research in the other direction, noting that China has also influenced its neighbors, Europe, and the wider world in turn. Nonetheless, this perspective remains dispersed, eclectic, and little-theorized. This gathering’s questions will extend in two directions: the historicization and theorization of what one might call ‘early modern Sinicization.’</p><p>Unearthing the many types of ‘reverse diffusionism’ in which Chinese practices spread to the world has rich explanatory promise, and may even be essential in achieving a more balanced understanding of causation in global history. On the one hand, this conference invites scholarship which explores how regions close and far from China transformed, adapted to, and struggled against Sinicization in the so-called early modern period, very roughly defined here as 1400-1800.</p><p>On the other hand, this conference also invites reflections on how to characterize ‘Sinicization’ itself. We also invite scholarship which poses major methodological, sociological, and even ethical questions about Sinicization, including:</p><p>• Which sociological categories should we use to describe these many tendencies and processes (‘creolization,’ ‘interculturation,’ ‘hybridization,’ ‘entanglement,’ ‘impact- response,’ ‘hegemony,’ ‘co-colonization,’ the ‘China-centered approach,’ etc.)?</p><p>• How to navigate the pratfalls of accidental Eurocentrism, uncritical Sinophilia, and<br/>essentialization of European and East Asian societies?</p><p>• How to include the stories of smaller polities, indigenous peoples, dynamic and creative<br/>individuals, and others caught between Europeanization, Sinicization, and other powerful<br/>social currents?</p><p><strong>DATES: </strong>15-17 June, 2023<br/><strong>INSTITUTION: </strong>University of Tübingen<br/><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Tübingen, Germany<br/><strong>LANGUAGE of presentations:</strong> English<br/><strong>APPLICATION DEADLINE:</strong> January 31, 2023<br/><strong>FORMAT:</strong> Hybrid; in-person and online </p><p><strong>ORGANIZERS: </strong>Prof. Dr. Renate Dürr, PD Dr. Philip Hahn, &amp;amp; Dr. Adrian Masters<br/><strong>SPONSORS:</strong> The German Research Foundation’s SFB 923-F04 and the University of Tübingen</p><p><em>Funding is available for travel and accommodations.

Implicit and explicit approval of antisemitism is tolerated or supported now by people with serious power. At the same time, there are fierce debates, particularly among Jews, about what exactly constitutes antisemitism. At the center of these debates are Zionism and Israel and Palestine: when does critique of Israel or Zionism cross the line into antisemitism? These two phenomena commingle to characterize the historical condition of antisemitism in today’s American society. Discussing these topics will be Peter Beinart, Lila Corwin Berman, and Jill Jacobs in a roundtable moderated by Alon Confino.</p><p> </p><p>Peter Beinart is Professor of Journalism and Political Science, City University of New York and editor at large of Jewish Currents.</p><p>Lila Corwin Berman is Murray Friedman Chair of American Jewish History, and Director of the Feinstein Center for American Jewish History, Temple University.</p><p>Rabbi Jill Jacobs is the CEO of T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights.</p><p>Alon Confino is Professor of History and Jewish Studies, Pen Tishkach Chair of Holocaust Studies, and Director of the IHGMS, UMass Amherst.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>[This event is co-sponsored by: The Judaic and Near Eastern Studies Department at UMass, Amherst; and T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights]</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ihgms@umass.edu">ihgms@umass.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://umass-amherst.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_-hX4y2vtRGKaQBob2bBN1w" target="_blank">https://umass-amherst.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_-hX4y2vtRGKaQBob2bBN1w</a></div></div></div></description>

<p>The American Religion and Literature Society (ARLS) invites papers for a panel at the American Literature Association Conference, May 25-28, 2023 in Boston.</p>
<p>We are seeking papers that explore the relevance of Midrash to contemporary literary criticism.</p>
<p>Midrash teaches that there exists not one authoritative meaning that we must discover but many possible meanings in whose unfolding we must participate. We see this happening in Talmud: a midrashic reader responds to a gap in the text by creating a narrative, which is, as Sandor Goodhart describes it, “a material extension” of the original text. The reader looks in between words, as well as in the space between God and man, in keeping with the rabbinic belief that meaning comes to be in dialogue between man and God. In this panel, we seek to consider how some of the attitudes and practices of ancient Midrash find echoes in contemporary theories of literary reading. Consider reader-response arguments that a text is not self-formulated but, rather, actualized through interpretation. Consider poststructuralist models in which the structure of language itself is interrogated and separated from the functioning of the literary.</p>
<p>We welcome papers that address questions including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>What critical approaches seem to take cues from or reinstate midrashic patterns? Or, where do you see correspondences between Jewish hermeneutics and secular criticism?
</li>
<li>How can an understanding of Midrash enrich our engagement with literary texts?
</li>
<li>How can the midrashic mode inform efforts to make meaning in a post-Holocaust, poststructuralist, or postmodern age, when structures of meaning have failed or been deconstructed?
</li>
<li>Does midrashic reading open up avenues for literary reading of sacred texts (as argued by Geoffrey Hartman)?
</li>
<li>What has been the lasting impact of what David Stern named “the midrash-theory connection” that was expressed during the 1980s? </li>
</ul>
<p>Please submit a 350-word paper proposal and short bio to <a href="mailto:kludwig@bsu.edu" target="_blank">kludwig@bsu.edu</a> by January 6, 2023.</p>

White (Brigham Young University)<br/>Brett Patterson<br/>James William Lincoln (University of Kentucky)<br/><br/><p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender and Philosophy </em>brings to the fore the Eastern, Western, and Indigenous philosophies that are implicit in the show.

The volume is also unique in drawing on less common traditions such as black abolitionism, anarchism, feminist care ethics, and the philosophy of martial arts. Intertwining experience and reflection, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender and Philosophy</em> helps readers to deeply engage with today’s burning questions, such as how to deal with ecological destruction, the aftermath of colonialism and genocide, and wealth inequality, using the tools from a wide range of philosophical traditions.</p>

This is not an imposition of Greek thinking, but an integration and transformation of Greek thinking in a Jewish context.  By understanding the breadth and depth of the entanglement of cultures, we can open up pathways and see growth and development in a tradition that was said to be closed off from abstract thinking and fractured from its surrounding culture.  Professor Najman will argue that this was not the case.  Rather, that Judaism, Hebrew, and the growth of new textual traditions continue to exhibit vitality and creative innovation throughout the Hellenistic period and beyond.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Hindy Najman is the Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture and the Director of the Oriel Centre for the Study of the Bible at the University of Oxford.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>She has written on the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rabbinic Literature and Pseudepigrapha.  Her publications include <i>Seconding Sinai: The Development of Mosaic Discourse in Second Temple Judaism </i>(2003), </span></span></span><span><span><span> <i>Past Renewals: Interpretive Authority, Renewed Revelation and the Quest for Perfection </i>(2010<i>) and  Losing the Temple and Recovering the Future: An Analysis of 4 Ezra</i></span></span></span><span><span><span> (2014).  She is currently completing a new book entitled: </span></span></span><i><span><span><span>Reading Practices and the Vitality of Scripture</span></span></span></i><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>UCL INstitute of Jewish Studies</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ijs@ucl.ac.uk">ijs@ucl.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/478135364747" target="_blank">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/478135364747</a></div></div></div></description>

Living in London and working towards the liberation of France from both Vichy rule and Nazi occupation, Weil was tasked by the Free French Forces in London with writing a dossier with advice for the future De Gaulle regime about how to deal with the trades unions. Not content to just write a policy paper, Weil wrote a “second magnum opus” instead. L’Enracinement (The Need for Roots) is a wide-ranging book that brings together political theory, ethical philosophy, and mystical theology, with a genealogical history of French political centralization, colonialism, and culture. With a new English translation of this rich work being published in 2023 the time is ripe for re-reading and re-evaluation of The Need for Roots. </p><p>The Executive Committee of The American Weil Society and the Department of Political Science at CU Boulder invite proposals for presentations at the 2023 Annual Colloquy on The Need for Roots.

Over the last decade, a growing number of scholars of the ancient, medieval, and modern worlds have argued that race has held a central place in politics, social relations, and culture. These scholars have challenged the received wisdom that ‘race’ simply popped up as an idea in late modern Europe. Significantly, Jews and Judaism have featured as important parts of this story.</p><p>The <strong>2023 British and Irish Association for Jewish Studies (<em><span>BIAJS2023</span></em>) conference</strong> will build on this work. The event will explore how race has affected, and been a part of, Jewish lives and beliefs across Jewish time and space, around the globe. In addition, <strong><em><span>BIAJS2023</span> welcomes papers on all aspects of Jewish Studies</em></strong>, and will provide the opportunity for participants to network with peers in Jewish Studies from Ireland, the UK, continental Europe, and the wider world.</p><div><h2><em><span>KEYNOTE SPEAKERS AT</span> </em><strong><em><span>BIAJS 2023</span></em></strong></h2></div><p><strong>Professor Miri Rubin, </strong>Professor of Medieval and Early Modern History, Queen Mary, University of London, and President, Jewish Historical Society of England.

But what are they trying to accomplish in this work? In this session, Ziva Hassenfeld will discuss her recently published research on students’ learning to read Torah, in order to argue that Jewish day schools can induct students into a way of reading texts that will serve them in all endeavors, from academics to text messaging with friends.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/mandel/about/faculty-staff/bios/hassenfeld.html" rel="nofollow">Ziva R. Hassenfeld</a> is the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel Assistant Professor in Jewish Education at Brandeis University. She studies reading comprehension from a sociocultural perspective, focusing on how children develop interpretations of the Hebrew Bible as a case of student reading development. She uses a variety of qualitative methods including ethnographic observation, stimulated recall interviewing and think-aloud interviewing. These investigations connect her to the worlds of biblical hermeneutics, both contemporary and rabbinic, as well as literary theory and criticism.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>ABOUT THE LEARNING ABOUT LEARNING SERIES</p><p>Join us virtually for a series of half-hour conversations hosted by Mandel Center Director <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/mandel/about/faculty-staff/bios/levisohn.html" rel="nofollow">Jon A. Levisohn</a>, in which leading scholars of Jewish education discuss what they have learned from their investigations of various aspects of Jewish education, and why it matters.

			<title>Third International Conference on Bartolomé de Las Casas</title>

Confirmed speakers <strong>Mariano Delgado</strong> and <strong>Paola Uparela</strong> will present new research seeking to understand Las Casas as a transatlantic “reformer.”</p><p>Charles Taylor’s provocative study, <em>A Secular Age</em>, identifies Reform as a broad conviction “felt with increasing power during the Middle Ages and early modern period, that not just an élite, but as far as possible all the faithful live up to the demands of the Gospel” (104). In line with this theme, organizers welcome proposals that put Las Casas in conversation with broader trends in sixteenth-century European expansionism, reformations, Christian humanism, secularization, theology, print culture, and law. Engagements stemming from post-colonial theory, literary studies, philosophy, anthropology, and other critical disciplines are also welcome.</p><p>Importantly, this conference calls attention to Las Casas’s entrance into a self-consciously reforming Dominican Order, itself an expression of trends in the renewal of religious life. Participants will benefit from and contribute to the rich combination of unique research interests afforded by this interdisciplinary invitation to consider Las Casas as a reformer in his own right. <strong>Proposals</strong> (in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish) of <strong>250 to 500 words</strong> in length and a <strong>short bio of 250 words</strong> are due by <strong>February 1, 2023</strong>: sent to <a href="mailto:submissions@lascasianstudies.org?subject=Conference%202023">submissions@lascasianstudies.org with “Conference 2023” as the subject</a>. The conference will be held in Spanish and English.</p><p>Accepted proposals will be invited to submit a written version of their presentations for consideration to be included in a projected <a href="https://brill.com/view/title/38269" rel="nofollow">third double-blind peer-reviewed collection</a>. For up to date information, visit<a href="https://mission-ministry.providence.edu/las-casas-studies-at-providence-college/" rel="nofollow"> Lascasian Studies at Providence College</a>.</p><p>The Third International Conference of Lascasian Studies will also provide the occasion for the official launching of the Society for Lascasian Studies and its Bulletin for Lascasian Studies. <strong>The conference will take place on the campus of Providence College in the picturesque city of Providence, Rhode Island. Limited opportunities for remote online presentations may be provided.</strong></p><p>Confirmed Keynote Speakers:<br/><a href="https://www.unifr.ch/theo/de/fak/pers/professoren/people/4379/544d5" rel="nofollow">Mariano Delgado</a>, Professor of Church and Mission History, University of Freiburg, Switzerland<br/><a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/paolauparela/" rel="nofollow">Paola Uparela</a>, Assistant Professor Spanish &amp; Portuguese Studies, University of Florida</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Fr.

						<description>Publication Name: The British Society for the Philosophy of Religion, Biennial Conference: Love, Religion, and God<br/><br/><p><strong>Keynote Speakers:</strong></p>
<p>Fiona Ellis (University of Roehampton)</p>
<p>Talbot Brewer (University of Virginia)</p>
<p>Judith Wolfe (University of St Andrews)</p>
<p>Paul Fiddes (University of Oxford)</p>
<p>The question of the relation between love, religion, and God is a central concern for both atheists and theists; and philosophers, theologians, and scientists have drawn interesting and sometimes conflicting conclusions about the nature of this relation and of the things related in this context. Can love be understood in the absence of God? Is love one thing or many things? And what is the relation between love and desire, or love and redemption? How are we to assess Nietzsche’s critique of Christian love? What is the role and value of love in non-theistic religious traditions? And in what sense, if any, should we accept that love is deeply mysterious?</p>
<p>These questions are attracting attention in recent scholarship, and the conference organisers are keen to examine the relevant issues from the vantage point of philosophy of religion as broadly conceived. We welcome papers taking a philosophical and/or theological approach to all aspects of love, religion, and God, including secular and diverse religious perspectives. We also encourage submissions from scholars who seek to make connections with other disciplines, such as religious studies, psychology, literature, and cognitive science. Members of under-represented groups are particularly encouraged to submit an abstract.</p>
<p>Those interested in presenting a short paper should send a proposal of no more than 250 words in a Word document to Dr David Worsley (david.worsley@york.ac.uk)<strong> no later than 31 March 2023.</strong> Please include the paper's title, and your name, institutional affiliation, and email address (these are not included in the 250 word word limit). We expect to notify people about whether their proposals have been accepted by 30 April 2023.</p>
<p>Some partial bursaries (including bursaries to cover the cost of childcare) may be available for participants who do not have another source of funding for attending the conference, with preference for these given to those who are presenting a paper. If you anticipate being in need of a bursary, please indicate this in your submission.</p>
<p>Conference registration closes on 13 August. Registration can be done via Eventbrite, here: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-bsprs-fifteenth-conference-love-religion-and-god-tickets-507654677807</p></description>

However, while these conferences considered the importance of “translation” in relation to postcolonial and decolonial theory, Africana studies, and gender and trans studies, this conference narrows its focus quite specifically on the problematic of “translation” itself. Indeed, we ask what is lost, but also what is gained in the act of translating religion.</p><p>Our starting point is translation theory and studies, the rich and vibrant field that takes into account questions of coloniality, cultural fluency, linguistic equivalence, and accented speech. To think about translation opens up the question of being haunted, possessed by, even surrendering to language and all of the cultural, political, and religious implications found within it. But, this process is one that is marked by risk, as the very act of translation prompts us to consider the enacting of wounds, the losses that manifest in the process. We acknowledge that the very form of this conference participates in monolingualism (namely, a particular form of English) in a U.S. based university, and thus, it is marked by the risk of another symbolic violence of translation in the transnational imbalance of power. We call attention to such limitations in hopes of generating a more thoughtful debate on these important issues. We hope this self-reflective awareness will be a consideration for participants.</p><p>In addition, we do not seek to remain solely within the realm of words and language. We also want to see what happens when “translation” moves into other registers, religious and interreligious registers that require us to think about the translation of beliefs, feelings, and thoughts into action or practice. We also turn to the problem of translation to consider what might not be translatable. Where might the procedures of equivalence and comparison become hegemonic practices that do not enact an appeal to “planetarity” but instead to power and control? As such, this conference seeks to consider how practices, ethics, and aesthetics of untranslatability might reroute or even upend such controlling grammars.</p><p>TTC invites papers from graduate students that explore the many dimensions of translation: its politics, methods, figures, concepts, and future directions, especially as these relate to the domain of religion. This year’s conference will be hybrid in its modality, and as such, we eagerly encourage submissions from those individuals who will present via Zoom as well as those who will be present on campus.</p><p>Proposals should be 200-300 words in length and include, as an attachment, a CV or brief bio that indicates the applicant’s institution, program, stage of completion, and area of focus/research interests. We welcome proposals for transdisciplinary papers as well as proposals for teaching sessions, activist engagement, art, or storytelling, and other creative approaches to engage the conference theme. <strong>Please submit your proposal to <a href="mailto:ttc@drew.edu">ttc@drew.edu</a> by January 15th in order to be considered.</strong> If accepted, presentations should be approximately 20 minutes in length (1,800-2,000 words).</p><p>Below are a few ideas of the kinds of conversations we are interested in having:</p><ul><li>The politics and aesthetics of translation</li><li>The figure of the “translator” or “interpreter” within religious, theological, and biblical studies</li><li>Community interpretation or the “community of interpreters”</li><li>Critical methods and methodologies for translation</li><li>Translating the category of “religion” across contexts (geographical, temporal, political, religious, etc.)</li><li>Symbols, symbolism, and symbolic languages</li><li>Untranslatable religious concepts or words</li><li>Translating thoughts, feelings, affects, or beliefs into action</li><li>The ineffable or ineffability</li><li>Poetics or theopoetics</li><li>Productive or inhibiting misinterpretations/mistranslations</li><li>The gift of tongues or speaking in tongues (glossolalia)</li></ul></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ttc@drew.edu">ttc@drew.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://drew.edu/theological-school/academics/doctor-of-philosophy/transdisciplinary-theological-colloquium/" target="_blank">https://drew.edu/theological-school/academics/doctor-of-philosophy/transdisciplinary-theological-colloquium/</a></div></div></div></description>

What does Mahloket look like at its best? How does Mahloket function as a kind of signature pedagogy (or at least a signature practice) within Jewish education? What does it mean to “educate for Mahloket,” and what are the benefits and challenges of doing so?

Among the varied array of talismans discovered from tombs, stupas, and ritual manuals, this talk focuses on a collage of the 24 Buddhist talismans to illustrate how these talismans provided vocabulary and structure to transform believers’ soteriological concerns and cosmological views in the Buddhist mortuary setting. Each talisman in the group was introduced from China and circulated independently from the early Koryŏ period (935–1392). But once combined in the Chosŏn period (1392–1910), the 24 talismans functioned as one giant talisman communicating a complex vision and comprehensive benefits. My findings ultimately suggest that multiple layers of ambiguities built around talismans, such as tensions between text and image, legibility and illegibility, as well as accessibility and inaccessibility, played a key role in enacting the efficacy and potency of talismans, and that the twenty-four talismans occupied a central place in sustaining Chosŏn Buddhist devotionalism.</span></span></p><h3>About the Speaker</h3><p><span><span>Sujung  Kim is Associate professor of Religious Studies at DePauw University. Sujung is specialized in Japanese and Korean Buddhism, interested in tracing the interaction between Buddhist cultures using textual and material sources in East Asian context. Her first book, <em>Shinra Myojin and Buddhist Networks of the East Asian “Mediterranean”</em> (University of Hawai‘i Press, 2019) focuses on a deity called Shinra Myōjin. The book explains that Shinra Myojin is not only an influential protector god of the Onjōji temple in Japan, but also part of the transnational network of people, ideas, and gods, spanning China, Korea, and Japan. Currently, Sujung is working on her second book project tentatively titled, <em>Korean Magical Medicine: Buddhist Healing Talismans in Chosŏn Korea</em>, which she investigates the religious, historical, and iconographic dimensions of healing talismans produced in Buddhist settings during the Chosŏn period. Although its primary focus is Korean talismans, the book also locates itself in the broader East Asian context, aiming at showing the complex web of talismanic culture in East Asia. This book project is supported by ACLS/Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation (AY 2021–2022), and she is also the recipient of the 1st KABS (Korean Association of Buddhist Studies) Mujin Writing Award (2021).</span></span></p><h4><span><span>Sponsored by the KU Center for East Asian Studies and the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures.</span></span></h4></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>LaGretia Copp</p><p>Program Assistant</p><p>Center for East Asian Studies</p><p>University of Kansas</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ceas@ku.edu">ceas@ku.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="http://ceas.ku.edu/" target="_blank">http://ceas.ku.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

The Talmud seemed to offer a perfect precedent for #MeToo in the story of a rabbinic leader who was chastened and dismissed for sexual violations. But is this an accurate reading of Moed Katan 17a?

<p>Avner Goldstein and Eleanor March invite abstract submission to session #107 ("The Materiality of Religion on the Atlantic Edge") at the 2023 annual meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists in Belfast.

<p><strong>Session Title and Number:<br/></strong>#107. The Materiality of Religion on the Atlantic Edge</p>
<p><strong>Organizers:</strong><br/>Avner Goldstein (Boston College, USA)<br/>Eleanor March (University of Exeter, UK)</p>
<p><strong>Deadline:</strong><br/>9 February 2023</p>
<p><strong>Submissions:</strong><br/><a href="https://eaa.klinkhamergroup.com/eaa2023/">https://eaa.klinkhamergroup.com/eaa2023/</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br/>Papers in this session explore the material culture of lived religion on the edge of the European Atlantic, from the Iron Age through the end of the Middle Ages. Following the successful EAA 2022 session “The Materiality of Lived Religion Under and After Rome,” we wish to continue discussions exploring the opportunities and interpretative challenges of using material culture for understanding ritual and religion. This year, particular attention is given to the materials, practices, performances, and experiences of religion in regions that lie along the European Atlantic, including Ireland, Great Britain, the North Sea, France, and Iberia. As well as introducing listeners to the particular materials of religion that are the focus of the paper, presenters should also address at least one of the following issues: the impact that Atlantic environments and landscapes had on ritual practices and understandings, or how lived religion’s material expressions were impacted depending on whether they were found at the centre or on the margins of empires, kingdoms, territories, communities, or societies. This session provides a space for serious discussion between practitioners working in different time periods, places, and disciplines about how to think about and use material evidence to reconstruct the lived experience of religion along the Atlantic’s edge.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong><br/>religion, history, environment, Iron Age, Roman, medieval</p>

			<title>[Today] Talk or similar: Two Types of the Critique of Religion - Dieter Birnbacher</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106585</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Dieter Birnbacher (Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf)<br/><br/><p>Dear Colleague,<br/><br/>You are invited to participate in the next session of the Logic and Religion Webinar Series which will be held on <strong>January 12, 2023</strong>, at <strong>4pm CET</strong> with the topic:</p>
<p><strong>TWO TYPES OF CRITIQUE OF RELIGION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Dieter Birnbacher (University of Düsseldorf, Germany)</p>
<p><strong>Chair</strong>: Jens Lemanski (University of Hagen, Germany)</p>
<p>Please, register in advance to receive the zoom link:<br/>https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars</p>
<p> <br/>Abstract: The talk distinguishes three main directions in the philosophical criticism of religion and  exemplifies them by the critique of religion contained in Schopenhauer’s Dialogue on religion: the inherent inability of religions to reveal the mythical nature of the objects of religious worship; the authoritarian nature of observing religious prescriptions; the allegation that religion produces more evil than good. On the last point, however, Schopenhauer is ambivalent: religion, to him, is the “philosophy of the masses” containing more than a grain of truth but in a form adapted to their seemingly limited intellectual capacities.</p>
<p>Join us 5 minutes prior to the beginning of the session!<br/> <br/>With best wishes,</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>Francisco de Assis Mariano <br/>The University of Missouri-Columbia<br/>LARA Secretary<br/>lara@logicandreligion.com</p></description>

Just as the forms of religious and spiritual activity change, the concept of a pilgrimage can be defined in different ways. Often this term is used to describe an exceptional travel to dedicated places of cultural and religious heritage, also without the presence of religious motivation. In this sense, a good example might be e.g. Camino de Santiago or the Holy Land. Sometimes a pilgrimage can be a travel to places related to famous people or cultural icons, like Memphis. We invite all researchers to submit talks and participate in the panel for studying the narrations of modern pilgrims, travel literature about places important (not only) for various religious traditions, as well as different aspects of experience learnt by pilgrims or religious tourists, analyses of their memories and travel reports, and finally cultural tourism that can be considered as religious pilgrimages.</p><p>We are looking for additional panelists interested in modern pilgrimage, cultural and religious tourism.</p><p>Submit your paper: <a href="mailto:pabloplichta@gmail.com">pabloplichta@gmail.com</a></p><p><span><span><span><span>Abstracts of no more than 300 words should be submitted no later than <strong>25 January, 2023</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p>Our panel takes place as part of the 6th Annual Conference of the European Academy of Religion in St Andrews, Scotland, UK, 19-23 Jun 2023.</p><p>The theme for this year’s gathering is Religion from the Inside, with keynote lectures planned by Prof. Jean-Luc Marion, Dr Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, Prof. Diwakar Acharya, Dr John Makransky, and Prof. Lejla Demiri. As in previous years, the conference programme will be composed of working sessions including: open panels; closed panels; book presentations; and keynote lectures focusing on the overarching topic, Religion from the Inside.</p><p>Religions join people in common endeavours, offer fulfilment and purpose to their adherents, and bind together the material and the immaterial. They can be described propositionally, but are whole ways of life. As such, religions have characteristics which may be clear to those within, but which are difficult to grasp for those without: inhabiting a building is different to looking over its blueprints. The examination of what is added (and what is lost) by taking the inside view is the theme of this year's annual meeting.</p><p>Religion from the Inside looks different in different religious traditions. Within some, the inside view is engaged mainly with questions of theology: the contemplation of the divine and all things in relation thereto. Within others, it is preoccupied with the conforming of human action to a more-than-human law. In yet other, an emic perspective focuses on the practice and experience of ritual. Reflection on sacred texts is common to many traditions, and often differs from external consideration of the same documents. Acknowledging the existence of emic knowledge can be an invitation to exploration and relationship rather than a method of isolation.</p><p>​Panel participating in the theme may choose to explore whether and how emic insights can be articulated in propositional form accessible to etic readers. They may engage with distinctively emic epistemologies, such as narrative traditions or second-person knowledge, which cast religious belief less as an intellectual acceptance of propositions than as an entry into a relationship. They may also discuss empirical questions of the differences religious faith or practice makes to perception, psychology, or individual and communal life. Equally, panels may examine the risks of insulated perspectives, including the exclusionary thrust of strong distinctions between insider and outsider, and the repudiation of common standards of truth.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Pawel Plichta: <a href="mailto:pabloplichta@gmail.com">pabloplichta@gmail.com</a></p><p>Barbara Wezgowiec: <a href="mailto:chopinka@poczta.fm">chopinka@poczta.fm</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:pabloplichta@gmail.com">pabloplichta@gmail.com</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.europeanacademyofreligion.org/conference-schedule" target="_blank">https://www.europeanacademyofreligion.org/conference-schedule</a></div></div></div></description>

<p>Call for Submissions Deadline: February 10, 2023</p>
<p>One of the challenges faced by translators of Arabic literary texts into English concerns the approaches used in rendering embedded religious content and allusions. In this panel, we invite presentations that focus on the strategies used by translators to convey the meaning of religious expressions, allusions, and symbols in a manner that takes into consideration the compatibility between the linguistic and conceptual planes. We would also like to address the strategies that translators of Arabic literature use to find equivalence and substitutes for particular Qur’anic connotations and implications in the source language and culture and their counterparts in the target language and culture.</p>
<p>In this AATA panel held in conjunction with MESA’s 57th annual meeting on November 2-5, 2023, in Montréal, Canada, we would like to focus on the rhetorical strategies and linguistic choices used in translating religious allusions and expressions in Arabic literature in English in relation to the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>• Strategies of semantic and syntactic approximations</li>
<li>• Adaptation and naturalization of culturally specific expressions</li>
<li>• Cultural, pragmatic and text specific problems</li>
<li>• Idiomatic expressions with religious allusions</li>
<li>• Functional equivalents and cultural substitutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We invite presenters interested in presenting on any of these or similar issues relevant to the panel topic to send a 300-word abstract and a short bio by <strong>Friday, February 10, 2023</strong>, to <strong><a href="mailto:aatapanel@gmail.com">aatapanel@gmail.com</a></strong></p>
<p>Accepted presentations should be delivered in Arabic.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br/>Stone is a durable, lasting medium. Even in its fragmentation, it exudes permanence, solidity, and symbolism. For millennia, humans have shaped stone, fashioning it into architectural wonders, sculptured monuments, objects of lived religion, and things of everyday use. At the same time, natural stonescapes, from caves and mountains to canyons and valleys, have played indisputable roles in the shaping of human experience and expression. Natural and hewn stone has long been used, reused, repurposed, and recycled in myriad contexts, at local, regional, and global levels. To this end, this session explores human relationships to stone from both historical and archaeological perspectives. It invites scholars of all time periods and geographies, but especially those working from the prehistoric to the medieval periods, to contribute papers exploring the experience of stone. Possible subjects include, but are not limited to: stone and the landscape; a phenomenology of stone; agentive stone; stone and lived religion; the theology of stone; the materiality of stone; the reuse of hewn or sculptured stone; the relationship of stone artifacts to ecofacts; stone and memory; or, shaping stone into space. Above all else, this session seeks to open a dialogue between eras, disciplines, methodologies, and geographies, with the particular aim of bringing archaeologists and historians into further conversation with one another.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong><br/>stone, phenomenology, sculpture and architecture, landscape archaeology, material culture, monumentality</p>

<p><strong>Type: </strong>Call for Papers</p>
<p><strong>Deadline for Submissions: </strong>April 1, 2023</p>

<p><em>Mormonism in Romantic and Victorian Print Culture</em></p>
<p>(Edited by Abby Clayton and Colby Townsend)</p>
<p>Coming on the heels of what is traditionally viewed as the Romantic period and bleeding into the Victorian, Mormonism serves as a lens through which to understand the diverse innovations in print culture during the long nineteenth century. Mormonism—not only a religious, but also a cultural and textual phenomenon—utilized a transatlantic print network almost from its moment of inception. Paradoxically, the same network exponentially multiplied the movement’s growth by reacting to and against its existence. These print systems became embodied as they moved people from the United Kingdom and continental Europe to the American West. The migration of bodies and texts through Mormonism staged key transatlantic nineteenth-century debates including questions about empire, indigenous peoples, gender and sexuality, authorship and composition, forms of prophecy, and religious canons.  </p>
<p>The editors seek essays that re-envision transatlantic Romantic and Victorian print networks through a consideration of Mormon or Mormon-inspired texts and culture. We invite contributors to analyze this period through a variety of literary, historical, and cultural methodologies. We aim to be inclusive in this volume through readings of lesser-known authors of the long nineteenth century, new readings of canonical texts, and treatments of religious movements as sites of political inquiry. This volume re-conceives literature as not just books and novels, but newspapers, tracts, pamphlets, and other print ephemera that are grounded in their materiality and their use in everyday situations by diverse readers and listeners. We invite interdisciplinary, transnational, and intersectional approaches to the question of religion and literature. </p>
<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Materiality of print and book history</li>
<li>Print ephemera, including railway yellow-backs, looseleaf and magazine extras</li>
<li>History of the novel, including satires, gothic, historical romances, and the “Oriental” tale</li>
<li>Reprinting and pirating culture</li>
<li>Myth of the author</li>
<li>Politics, French Revolution, Anti-Jacobinism, Democracy, Imperialism, and the Subaltern</li>
<li>Representations of Mormonism in print media and Anti-Mormon literature</li>
<li>Lost manuscripts found, ghosts and guardian spirits</li>
<li>The fantastic and the sublime in Romantic, Victorian, and Mormon texts</li>
<li>Form, genre, and narrative theory in 18C and 19C print culture</li>
<li>Gender, minorities, and the “Other” in 18C and 19C texts, including voice and literacy</li>
<li>The problems of scripture and canon in literary criticism</li>
<li>Disability in 18C and 19C print culture</li>
<li>The challenges of locating disability in already contested archives (e.g. slavery, colonialism, etc.)</li>
<li>Oratory, eloquence, and sermon culture</li>
<li>Time and Critical Geographies</li>
<li>Text, image, and credulity in the long nineteenth century</li>
<li>Digital archives and Romantic, Victorian, and Mormon manuscripts</li>
<li>Romantic, Victorian, and Mormon poetry</li>
<li>Portrayals of polygamy in history</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome submissions from professors, adjunct or contingent faculty, independent scholars, post-docs, and graduate students working in a variety of fields, including history, religion, literature, and others in the humanities. Please submit abstracts (300–500 words), an abbreviated CV, and a short bio to editors Abby Clayton (<a href="mailto:aclayto@iu.edu">aclayto@iu.edu</a>) and Colby Townsend (<a href="mailto:colbtown@iu.edu">colbtown@iu.edu</a>) by April 1, 2023.

Kristin M.S. Bezio (University of Richmond) and Samantha Dressel (Chapman University).</p>
<p> The issue have proposed a final deadline of fall 2023 for publication, and we are asking for abstract proposals by March 1, 2023. Assuming all proposed abstracts fit the theme, we are hoping for initial drafted chapters by 1 July 2023 to allow time for revisions and editing before entering the production process. Final chapters will be due to Religions for peer review, etc., by 15 October 2023.</p>
<p> We are inviting essays that pertain, broadly speaking, to the ideas of spectacle, ritual, and drama as it relates to questions or practice of religion. We are particularly interested in essays that include global, non-white (or not only white), and non-Anglocentric (or not only Anglocentric) perspectives. </p>
<p>Spectacle lies at the heart of both ritual and drama, and religion is often similarly to be found at the core of both. Whether a spectacle is tied to ritualized praxis, to celebration or mourning, or to the production of a dramatic performance, elements of religious culture are often foregrounded, particularly in the medieval and early modern world.</p>
<p> This Special Issue aims to showcase essays that discuss the impact and depictions of religious belief and conflict in public ritual and drama throughout the medieval and early modern periods. Specifically, the issue seeks essays that cross multiple boundaries, whether religious, cultural, social, or geographical in terms of their depictions of public spectacle, whether religious, dramatic, or both. Essays in this volume should also consider the importance of their argument’s focus to larger questions of inclusion, equity, and diversity, either within the period or relative to more contemporary discussions, whether in the classroom or in the wider world. </p>
<p> In this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome. Research areas may include (but are not limited to) the following: religious studies, theology, literature and drama, history, art history, musicology, archaeology, or another relevant field. We ask for articles that focus on the middle ages through the early modern period (understood as flexible based on the region(s) under consideration) and specifically pertain to the focal topic of the special issue (religions in ritual, spectacle, and drama).</p>
<p>Please submit abstracts directly to Drs. Bezio &amp; Dressel (<a href="mailto:kbezio@richmond.edu">kbezio@richmond.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:sdressel@chapman.edu">sdressel@chapman.edu</a>) before March 1, 2023. The editors will evaluate abstracts and respond promptly with an invitation to submit chapters within two weeks of the deadline.</p>

<p>Muslims were tolerant of queer genders and were condemned by Medieval Western intellectuals for it. However, modern secular Western polemics of individual human rights and autonomy condemn them for being oppressive. South Asia is home to the world’s largest Muslim population with a variety of religious schools of thought. South Asian Muslimness and their behaviors to <em>khawaja sira </em>and<em> hijra</em> genders/sex have been an interesting case to study intersectionality of Muslimness and queer gender tendencies/practices in a subject because of an intriguing diversity in the behaviors over time and space from being highly regarding, accommodative, moderate, conservative and oppressive. Literatures produced by South Asian Muslims in different languages have engaged with non-normative genders and intimacies including <em>khawaja</em> <em>sira</em> and <em>hijra</em> subjects depicting an enriched variety of their social status/places and ‘lived’ experiences over a history of hundreds of years of the presence and practices of <em>interpretations</em> of Islam in the region. Especially, recently, Pakistani and Bangladeshi Anglophone literatures have attracted international critical scholarly attention for being growingly transgressive in engaging with non-normative genders in the contexts of reignited grappling between secular and religious discourses, charged religiosity, intense cross-(b)orders mobility, compressing/fraying spatial and cultural distinctions, globalization, neoliberalism and resurgent far-right popular masculinist religio-nationalist politics in the region.</p>
<p>Muslim queerness cannot be homogenized into the category of ‘queer of color’ and, further, South Asian Muslim queernesses cannot be reduced and homogenized into Muslim queerness. There are subtle and nuanced institutional, geopolitical, temporal, spatial, individual, affective and humanist distinctions intersected by religious interpretations and nationalisms which require scholarly attention to be explored and examined to foreground Muslim queer imaginaries and underline the struggles, resistance and negotiations of Muslim queers in their historical specificities in South Asia. While reading the intersectionality of Muslimness and queer gender/sexual subjectivity as depicted in South Asian literatures, the aim of this edited book volume is to bring into the limelight Muslim queer marginalities from within queerness of color in South Asia which is in itself on margins in the Western canonical polemics of queerness. Its objectives are to explore 1) Muslim concepts about and Muslimness of queer gender/sex. 2) Muslim queer subjects, subjectivation and subjectivities. 3) Temporal, spatial, social and political shifts in the imaginaries and subjectivities of/about queers intersected by shifts in religious interpretations/understandings or politico-religious praxis to define gender and sexual moralities.</p>
<p>It intends to read South Asian literary inscriptions of Muslim queer imaginaries, temporalities and subjects from a decolonial perspective which critiques the epistemological violence of Euro-America-centric universalism along with underlining the violence of local heteronormative gender/sexual moralities defined by shifts in religious thoughts.</p>
<p>Though all South Asian religions have had an important role in defining gender moralities, this book focuses on how Muslimness has particularly been implicated in an essential intersecting role to define and shape the lives of trans, <em>khawaja sira</em> and <em>hijra</em>.</p>
<p>It invites original contributions in English in the form of critical essays which explore the complexities of South Asian Muslim queer imaginaries and subjects as depicted in literatures written by Muslim or non-Muslim writers of South Asian origin in English or any other regional language. It particularly wants its essays to critically engage in a dialogue with Euro-American universalist and local heteronormative theoretical frames to point out their reductiveness and limits, and to foreground distinctive decolonial and resistive epistemological subtlety(ies) to read South Asian Muslim queer imaginaries and subjects by examining their distinctive complexities and situatedness in which religion is an essential defining element amongst other intersecting factors. It wants its essays to examine how religious trajectories have recognized/derecognized, oppressed/emancipated/rescued, neglected, tolerated, accepted, turned a blind eye to, enabled/disabled and empowered Muslim queers. It also wants its contributors to be self-reflexive and conscious of their researcher positionality while reading the queer.</p>
<p>The essays may focus on either of (but not limited to) the following thematic areas reflected in South Asian literatures:</p>
<p>Typology of Muslim queer imaginary</p>
<p>Transitions in the constructions of Muslim queer imaginary and subjects</p>
<p>Subjectivation and subjectivities of Muslim queers</p>
<p>Social and political status of <em>khawaja sira</em>, <em>hijra</em> and trans</p>
<p>Political erasure and rendering non-subjects of certain queer desires and subjective groundings</p>
<p>Selective acceptance and tolerance of queer experiences</p>
<p>Groundings of Muslims’ behaviors towards queers</p>
<p>Elevation of <em>khawaja sira</em> and <em>hijra</em> to high social and political posts and perspectives behind it</p>
<p>Contemporary Muslim queer politics</p>
<p>Strategic potential and limitations of religious/secular approaches to ensure rights of queers</p>
<p>Diasporic Muslim queer subjects</p>
<p>Narratives and perspectives of queers towards religion regarding their queer subjectivities</p>
<p>Intersectionality or mutual exclusiveness of religion and non-heteronormative intimacies/desires in a queer subject</p>
<p>We are inviting abstracts (350 words along with a bionote of 50 words in a single MS Word file) by January 31, 2023. Kindly send your abstract to <a href="mailto:msnbajwa@gmail.com">msnbajwa@gmail.com</a></p>

			<title>[ September 2, 2024 -  September 4, 2024] Conference or similar: Third Austrian Summer School in Phenomenology</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123450</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The Austrian Society for Phenomenology launches its third international summer school. Our objective is to promote the research of young scholars (bachelor, master, and doctoral students) that sheds new phenomenological light on current debates in epistemology, metaethics, and metaphysics. The descriptive analysis of lived experience, the eidetic study of the various modes of intentionality, and the epistemic role and normative dimensions ascribed to experience constitute the cornerstones of phenomenological research. In particular, Husserl’s conceptions of originary givenness, evaluative experience, and eidetic intuition are among the various seminal contributions we find in the phenomenological tradition. Currently, promising research is done that utilizes such conceptions in order to develop phenomenological perspectives on experiential justification, the debate between epistemic internalism and externalism, the theory of value, (moral) emotions, moral epistemology, issues surrounding metaphysical realism and anti-realism, as well as the epistemology and metaphysics of modality. We would like to encourage students to develop phenomenological insights and teachings systematically and in view of contemporary debates in philosophy. Our ambition is to promote such phenomenological research by providing a platform to connect with, discuss with, and receive feedback from peers and experts. Each conference day is devoted to one of the subtopics of the event.</p></description>

			<title>[ June 28, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Resilience against extremism: Protecting individuals, communities, and democratic institutions</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123426</link>
						<description><p>This workshop focuses on the concept of resilience against extremism. “Resilience” refers to an individual’s or community’s ability to adapt and thrive in adverse or challenging circumstances by knowing how to find, create, access, and navigate meaningful coping resources. Extremism threatens individuals, communities, institutions, and societies on multiple dimensions. First, they are confronted with extreme behaviour and its consequences. Second, they are confronted with the presence of extremism in their environment, fostering adverse conditions. Third, they may themselves run the risk of radicalisation. Pro-social resilience against all these adversities is a complex phenomenon requiring a broad range of methodological perspectives and approaches.</p>
<p> Relevant questions include but are not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>How should we conceptualise resilience against extremism in light of different fields’ approaches to the issue? Is, for instance, resilience always prosocial?</li>
<li>What role do cultural, political, economic, and other systemic factors play in fostering resilience and how do they relate to beliefs and dispositions of individuals that constitute communities? </li>
<li>Which individuals, groups and institutions are responsible for fostering pro-social resilience, and how do these responsibilities interact?</li>
<li>Is resilience of a community compatible with the radicalisation of some of its members? </li>
<li>How does resilience in the moral, political, and religious domains relate to each other? For example, does moral resilience foster religious resilience or vice versa?</li>
<li>Can resilience be operationalised and measured? </li>
<li>How does resilience relate to deradicalization and disengagement from extremist behaviour? </li>
<li>How should we construe the resilience of democratic institutions and societies ontologically and epistemologically, in contrast with the resilience of individuals or communities?</li>
<li>Are there specific best practices for building resilience towards, for example, right-wing extremism, Salafi Jihadism, inceldom, and radical conspiracy theorizing that can be implemented elsewhere? </li>
<li>What is the role of education in creating resilience?</li>
<li>What are religious and secular resources - beliefs, practices, rituals, systems - that can help make communities resilient against radicalization?</li>
<li>Should radicalisation itself be modelled as a resilient but dysfunctional response to adverse circumstances?</li>

The focus will be on examining how these seemingly disparate worlds converged, shaping artistic production across various disciplines.</p>
<p>The impact of esotericism on the avant-garde movement is discernible from its earliest stages. Wassily Kandinsky, a trailblazer in the realm of abstraction, serves as a prominent illustration of this inclination. His seminal work, "Concerning the Spiritual in Art" (1910), underscores the pursuit of inner experience through the utilization of symbolic forms. This emphasis aligns closely with the underlying currents of esoteric thought, which aimed to uncover concealed dimensions of reality through symbolic representation and ritualistic practices. Kandinsky's theories, far from being solely speculative, laid the foundation for a novel artistic lexicon that transcended the confines of the material realm.</p>
<p>Beyond theoretical underpinnings, esotericism actively shaped artistic movements. Surrealism, with its exploration of the subconscious and the dream world, became a haven for artists like Max Ernst, Leonora Carrington, and Remedios Varo. These figures, along with Hilma af Klint and Anna Cassel (pioneers of abstract art), incorporated arcane symbolism and spiritual themes into their work. The mystical teachings of figures like Pyotr Demianovich Ouspensky and George Ivanovich Gurdjieff, who prioritized self-knowledge and hidden dimensions of reality, were particularly influential on artists like Varo and Carrington.</p>
<p>Beyond the visual arts, the Symbolist and Cubist movements, with its focus on suggestion and the unseen, drew heavily on occult themes. Writers like Guillaume Apollinaire explored these themes in their work. Surrealist playwright Antonin Artaud, fascinated by alchemy, Kabbalah, and mediumistic practices, sought a transformative theatrical experience through esoteric means. His "Journey to the Land of the Tarahumaras" (1936) exemplifies this, documenting peyote use and portraying Mexico as a mystical, forbidden land. Even Modernist writers like W.B. Yeats and T.S. Eliot incorporated elements of theosophy and mysticism into their poetry.</p>
<p>Given avant-gardists’ significant engagement with magic and the occult, this panel aims to investigate the intriguing dynamic between materiality and spirituality. Potential areas of exploration encompass, yet extend beyond, the following topics:</p>
<p>· Kandinsky's abstract mysticism and theosophical influences in "Concerning the Spiritual in Art."</p>
<p>· Abstract visions in the works of Hilma af Klint and Anna Cassel.</p>
<p>· George Ivanovich Gurdjieff, Pyotr Demianovich Ouspensky and the hermetic discourse of the avant-garde.</p>
<p>· Mexico and the magical in the Surrealism of Wolfgang Paalen, Victor Brauner, Eva Sulzer, and other artists.</p>
<p>· The enduring legacy of the occult in Modernist literature.</p>
<p>· The presence of Kabbalistic practices and indigenous rituals in Artaud's theater.</p>
<p>· The esoteric revival and the Modernist imagination in Yeats and Eliot.</p>
<p>· Phantasmagoric imagery in the photographs of Alvin Langdon Coburn.</p>
<p>· Reframing the feminine avant-garde through the archetype of the witch in the artworks of Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo, Kati Horna.</p>
<p>By June 24, please submit an abstract of 250-300 words, a brief bio, and any A/V or scheduling requests to Leticia Pérez Alonso at <a href="mailto:leticia.p.alonso@jsums.edu">leticia.p.alonso@jsums.edu</a>.</p>

Did you experience homophobia and/or transphobia while in attendance? Do you want to share your story in order to ensure what happened to you doesn’t happen to students in the future? Then I want to hear from you!</p>
<p>For these stories, I am not looking for overviews of your entire time at the school; rather, I am looking for stories that concentrate on one particular experience at the school that best encapsulates what it was like for you as a queer student to attend. A few examples of this include a story about when a campus employee took a student into a room and prayed for the Demon of Moloch to leave him; a story about when a student went to a hotel off-campus for a Grindr hookup and, once there, figured out that his hook up with with another student from his school who was an RA; a story about when one student was interrogated about her romantic relationship with her roommate by her RA; etc. As you can see, we are not looking for narratives that span weeks, months, or years, but instead, we are looking for very specific, detailed stories that focus in on one (or two) events and how that event (or those two events) speak(s) to what it was like to attend your school as a queer student. These stories are to be written as <em>creative nonfiction pieces</em>, not academic or personal essays (the reader for these stories is a general reader, most likely a formerly religious person and/or queer folx). Some folx may be asked to anonymize the names of individuals in their stories, though the names of the schools that the authors attended need not (and most likely will not) be anonymized. Authors of these stories may also choose to anonymize themselves. </p>
<p>For the time being, the Press is looking for a 5-sentence description of the stories potential contributors would like to write. (You can certainly start writing the whole story if you'd like, or, if you'd prefer, we can discuss what would be a suitable story by either e-mail or by Zoom--whichever you prefer!) I am also asking folx to send along a 3-5 sentence bio with their 5 sentence story description. I am hoping to have these descriptions and bios by June 1. From there, potential contributors will have a few months to write their stories (they will be due by August 15)--after that, I will get back to contributors within a month with my decision on if their stories are accepted.</p>

			<title>[ May 17, 2024] Talk or similar: The Question of Listening</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123378</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Stathis Gourgouris<br/><br/><p>Link for participation: https://cuhk.zoom.us/j/97418441588?pwd=UGVFam9qNUFFUG1sVTVrZVEvak9Gdz09 </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A bizarre paradox runs through the history of philosophy. Since the time of Aristotle, philosophy has been defined as the knowledge of the universal, and what is singular is excluded from the domain of what is knowable. At the same time, however, the history of philosophy has continually been confronted – starting with Aristotle, and even earlier with Plato – with the problem of defining what it means to be singular.</p>
<p>The notion of ‘singularity’ is intertwined with – and distinguished from – other fundamental terms in the philosophical lexicon: the one, the individual, the person, the absolute, but also the contingent, the unrepeatable, the unexpected. It seems to define at the same time what is lowest and irrelevant (a detail, a contingency) and what is supreme and of utmost importance (the absolute, God).</p>
<p>In modern thought, the possibility of clearly distinguishing between the singular and the universal is radically called into question. Philosophical interest in history and art leads one to challenge the idea that philosophy cannot deal with the singular. The birth of Aesthetics and Philosophy of history, as well as the philosophical meditation on the contingent and evenemential aspects of human life, constitute a new stage in the relationship of philosophical thought to the category of the singular.</p>
<p>The aim of this seminar series will be to discuss the notion of the ‘singular’ starting from the history of philosophical thought, but also in relation to the use of this term in the contemporary debate. The research hypothesis is that philosophy still has to come to terms with the notion of the singular, and that thinking deeply about this notion can help us to shed light on some theoretical problems still open today.</p>


<p>The seminar series is co-organised by the University of Freiburg (Chair of Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The project consists of a series of two-hour online meetings: each meeting will be opened by a 30-minute talk by an internationally recognised scholar. This will be followed by 90 minutes for discussion.</p></description>

						<description><p>In recent years, the notion of resonance has gained a prominent place in contemporary thought for its plasticity in representing commonalities, interactions, and reverberations in relational ontologies. However, its heuristic potential for thinking and grounding the dynamism of “presencing absence” has yet to be fully explored. By addressing the notion of resonance from different disciplinary perspectives, this one-day workshop aims to contribute to an ongoing dialogue in interdisciplinary research between philosophers and theorists, performers, artists, and practice-based art scholars.</p>
<p>We welcome paper presentations that address the notion of resonance and/or absence in ways that foster interdisciplinary dialogues, either in a scholarly spirit or from a first-person experience. In particular, but not limited to, those that address philosophical and theoretical contributions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moods, affective spaces, and atmospheres </li>
<li>Reflections on the body, movement, and spatialization </li>
<li>Memory and spectres </li>
<li>Art and activism </li>
<li>Other related topics in current research advances in the visual and performative arts</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested speakers should submit a 250-word abstract and a brief biographical note (max. 100 words) to <strong>rcanales@letras.ulisboa.pt</strong> with the subject “RESONANCE Workshop” by <strong>May 20th, 2024</strong>. Decisions will be announced on May 22nd. The working language of the workshop will be English. The event has no registration or fees.</p></description>

						<description>Publication Name: Conceptualising the Abyss in religion<br/><br/><p><em><strong>Conceptualising the Abyss in religion</strong></em></p>
<p>As a common expression and proverb, "the abyss calls to the abyss" is intended to signify both a chain reaction and a deeper, potentially endless or bottomless fall: one excess leads to another excess, one crime leads to another crime, one evil throws us into a greater evil. However, in its original biblical sense, taken from <em>Psalm</em> 41:8, it has less pejorative connotations, in that it expresses the indefectible bond that exists between the believer and God, especially when the latter tends to merge with the invisible. <em>The abyss that calls (Abyssus)</em>, on the other hand, is that of the apostle insofar as he represents all believers, because he is aware of the road ahead and the trials that will face him in his quest for God. <em>The abyss that is called (Abyssum),</em> on the other hand, is that of God, unfathomable, abstruse we might also say, eluding all human knowledge/understanding, both in his answers and in his presence. As for the verb to call (<em>invocare</em>), this invites us to think of a call to ourselves, close to ourselves, which is above all a call for help: the distress of a fallen and sinful creature. The abyss of man asks, and therefore hopes, that the divine abyss will answer his call and save him from an inner battle that he is not certain of winning alone. From then on, the act of calling is not devoid of hope, in which anxiety and the desire for a response are intertwined. Finally, the certainty expressed in <em>Psalm</em> 41:12: "He is my saviour and my God" indicates the noblest attitude to adopt, even when God remains silent and absent. Commenting on this psalm, Augustine multiplies this already twofold abyss, since the abyss refers not only to God's incomprehensible judgements, the divine ways and God himself, but also to the human heart - the deepest abyss, so subject is it to inner distortion - to mankind in general, to human weakness, to sin, or even to the depth of the sea. For the Bishop of Hippo, the notion of the abyss refers to the mysterious depths of man and God, because each in its own way is an inexhaustible source of incomprehension that we must try to unravel and grasp (1). The <em>Confessions</em> themselves could be read as a human attempt to approach the abyss that we are in the face of a second, much nobler abyss, which is God, into which we must try to plunge ... to sink. And yet the silence and absence of God nonetheless open up an abyss of meaning that never ceases to question and is conducive to doubt. The absence of God is perceived as a void, if not a vacancy to be filled by something else: where Job remains faithful to God despite trials and afflictions, the contradictory existence of evil and suffering, the "death of God" leaves man alone in the face of an abyss, faced with the challenge of creating new values that are no longer hostile to life (the superhuman/the nihilism of the last man) (2).</p>
<p>The multi-faceted nature of the abyss is at the root of these diverse and even opposing reactions. Indeed, the abyss has a properly topological meaning: it refers to a concrete physical place, but one that has the particularity of always being unfathomable. As the Greek etymology <em>ἄβυσσος</em> "bottomless" testifies, venturing into it is already losing oneself in it. The abyss is therefore characterised by an impossibility of being identified in its depth and totality since it escapes, by definition, any attempt at understanding and mastery. With its pejorative connotations, it often gives rise to fear and anxiety (3) and is associated with Hell and sin. The same is true of the verb abîmer, which refers to the action of altering, degrading or even destroying something. However, it can also mean to <em>damage</em>, in the sense of <em>modifying</em>, in particular to make something better. To "fall into God" is not so much a fall as an elevation to him, but one that no one can accomplish and from which no one emerges unscathed. Finally, the abyss is a concept close to the infinite (4), in that they both refer to the idea of the unfathomable, so much so that the abyss becomes the other name for God himself (5). That this abyss escapes man is then a sign, even a proof, of God's existence and of a greatness to be respected and admired (6). On this point, the humility of not wanting to understand/know God outside the abyss that defines him implies assigning limits to theological discourse, to the very possibility and legitimacy of theology. In short, we need to ask what can be said about the abyss in religion, since it seems from the outset, by virtue of its definition, to escape discourse.</p>
<p>This issue of <em>ThéoRèmes</em> is an interdisciplinary issue, inviting epistemological and comparative reflection on the uses of the concept of the abyss in religion. The dossier is particularly open to studies of the notion in other religions: is there or is there not such a concept or its equivalent? How is it translated? What exactly is the religious conceptual framework in which it is used? The articles may deal with the notion in one or more authors or in the corpus of a tradition of thought or religion. Similarly, it is possible to approach the concept from other fields or disciplines, such as phenomenology, but it is important to make the link with the abyss 'in religion'. Proposals for articles may fit into one or more of the following areas of reflection:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The theological axis:</strong> how have different religions and philosophies conceptualised the abyss in religion? How are the different abysses (God's abyss, man's abyss, hell's abyss, sin's abyss) thought of, and in relation to each other? What does the abyss have to offer in relation to neighbouring concepts such as infinity?</li>
<li><strong>The epistemological axis</strong>: what are the conditions of possibility and truth of all discourse and thought on the abyss? Should the faculties of knowledge mobilised to immerse themselves in the abyss reject reason in favour of intuition (sensitive, intellectual, mystical)? Does a theology of the abyss necessarily imply a doctrinal impoverishment?</li>
<li><strong>The moral and political axis</strong>: what normativity can a theology of the abyss exercise, particularly for an ecclesial institution? Does a theology of the abyss imply doctrinal tolerance, given the unfathomability of God?</li>
<li><strong>The literary and aesthetic axis:</strong> how can the abyss be depicted or represented artistically? What are the recurring metaphors used to evoke it? How is the sublime the aesthetic experience of the abyss?</li>
<li><strong>The psychological axis:</strong> what emotions or affects does the abyss arouse (fear, admiration, fascination, humility)? How can we deal with the abyss within us? To what extent is the human interior, the heart or conscience, the abyss of his being?</li>
</ul>
<p><u>How to submit :</u></p>
<p>Deadline for sending proposals, 500 words: 01/07/2024 at manon.gibot@ephe.psl.eu <strong>and</strong> andy.serin@univ-paris1.fr<br/>Reply to authors: 05/07/2024 at the latest.<br/>Deadline for articles, 40,000 characters including spaces: 05/01/2025</p>
<p>Articles will then be submitted to the journal's evaluation procedure (https://journals.openedition.org/theoremes/116): double-blind expertise, then submitted to the Scientific Committee for validation</p>
<p><u>Notes:</u></p>
<p>(1) Georgiana Huian writes of Augustine's commentary that it "does not engage in a game of personifications of the abyss, but a breakthrough of the mystery that calls into question the constitution of the 'subject' by referring to intersubjectivity", <em>Augustin. Le cœur et la crise du sujet</em>, Paris, Cerf Patrimoines, 2020, p. 187. See also: Françoise Vinel, "L'abîme appelle l'abîme... (Ps. 41 (42), 8). Plaidoyers pour l'allégorie dans quelques commentaires du psautier, d'Eusèbe à Augustin", in Pierre Maraval (ed.), <em>Le psautier chez les Pères</em>, Strasbourg, Centre d'Analyse et de Documentation Patristiques, 1994, p. 251.</p>
<p>(2) All of Dostoyevsky's thought is also haunted by this question of the death of God, of his absence, of the abyss of incomprehension in the face of the violence of the world. For example, the "Revolt" chapter of The <em>Brothers Karamazov.</em></p>
<p>(3) Kierkegaard, faced with the anguish that freedom can provoke in man, compares anguish to vertigo: "when the eye plunges into an abyss, one has vertigo, which comes as much from the eye as from the abyss, because one might not have looked", Le concept d'angoisse, Paris, Gallimard, 1935, p. 90.</p>
<p>(4) In his fragment "Disproportion", Pascal mentions the term abyss several times in connection with infinity, explaining that he wants "to make him see a new abyss in there" (emphasis added).</p>
<p>(5) Apophatic and mystical theology more generally have taken seriously this definition of a God who can neither be named nor defined, by associating him, for example, with nothingness, and by placing experience itself at the heart of their thinking. See, for example, Maitre Eckhart.</p>
<p>(6) The notion of the sublime in Kantian aesthetics holds together this idea of a positive abyss that arouses fascination and respect, as well as fear. The sublime, as abyss, absolute immensity and transgression of limits, exceeds the human scale. As Paulette Carrive explains, "the analysis of the sublime is undoubtedly at the heart of the entire Kantian system, for it reveals man in the interiority of his greatness and humility" ("le sublime dans l'esthétique de Kant", in<em> Revue d'Histoire littéraire de la France,</em> 86e année, no. 1, Le sublime (Jan.-Feb., 1986), pp. 78-79. See <em>Critique of the Faculty of Judgement,</em> II, "Analysis of the Sublime", § XXIII to XXVIII.</p></description>

			<title>[ May 10, 2024 -  May 11, 2024] Conference or similar: Time and Language: An Encounter Between Philosophy and Philology</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/122874</link>
						<description>Venue: 801 Hilgard Ave<br/><br/><p>Outside of analytic philosophy, there is a strain of contemporary research in fields such as Comparative Literature, German, French, and Religious Studies that approaches the study of language through the lens of philology. Much of the recent popularity of philology is due to the late Werner Hamacher, whose works, including “95 Theses on Philology” and “For—Philology” are inexhaustible wells of philological insight. Presently, philosophers remain largely ignorant of such philological research, just as philological researchers may be unaware of the contemporary philosophical interest in philologically relevant topics like metasemantics, the evolutionary origins of language, semantic drift, and conceptual engineering/amelioration. This event is a first-of-its-kind opportunity for philosophers and philological researchers to come together and share their research on topics like these and much, much more.</p></description>

			<title>[ August 16, 2024 -  August 17, 2024] Conference or similar: Re-evaluating Jakob Friedrich Fries: 200th Anniversary of the Publication of System der Metaphysik</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/122846</link>
						<description>Venue: Otemachi I cho-me 1-4<br/><br/><p><strong>“Re-evaluating Jakob Friedrich Fries: 200th Anniversary of the Publication of <em>System der Metaphysik</em>”</strong></p>
<p>*co-sponsored by the 2nd Numazu Congress of Philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong></p>
<p>August 16–17, 2024 (tentative)</p>
<p>The history of philosophy began with Thales in ancient Greece and reached a pinnacle in 19th-century Germany. However, the conventional image of 19th-century German philosophy must be reconsidered. To accomplish this, it is essential to illuminate a forgotten philosophical stream that existed alongside so-called ‘German idealism’.</p>
<p>Philosopher Jakob Friedrich Fries, a contemporary and frequent challenger of Hegel, emerges as one of the most important figures in this context. One of Fries’ most significant books is <em>System der Metaphysik</em> – a bible for the philosophy of Fries and his followers, the so-called ‘Friesian School’, which dominated the philosophical and scientific world of the 19th century. After the fall of the Friesian school, the Neo-Friesian school, founded by Leonard Nelson, dominated the scientific world in the 20th century.</p>
<p>The year 2024 marks the 200th anniversary of the publication of <em>System der Metaphysik</em>. This conference aims to reconsider Fries’ philosophy and the significance of Fries, as well as Friesian and Neo-Friesian thought, in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
<p>This conference will also attempt to reconstruct the picture of 19th-century German philosophy. During the 19th and 20th centuries, thinkers beyond Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel – especially Fries – significantly influenced the history of philosophy, presenting alternatives to Hegel’s vision.</p>
<p>From this perspective, this conference will address themes including but not limited to:</p>
<p>- The historical background of Jakob Friedrich Fries</p>
<p>- The Friesian and Neo-Friesian schools</p>
<p>- Friesian philosophy and the history of philosophy</p>
<p>- Fries and the philosophy of science</p>
<p>- Fries and the philosophies of culture</p>
<p>- Fries and Japanese philosophy</p>
<p>- Fries and contemporary philosophy</p>

<p>“`Do This In Remembrance of Me’: Religion, Memory, and Art”</p>
<p>A Special Issue of <em>Religion and the Arts</em></p>
<p>Guest Editor: Frederick S. Roden</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Religion and the Arts </em>solicits essays for a special issue on the relationship between religion, memory, and art.  Whether through ritual and liturgy, sacred arts and objects, or narrative imperatives, borders between religious and secular meet in memory.  Epigenetics and intergenerational trauma/imprinting, as well as DNA and archival searches for origins, compete with and complement ancient discourses of karmic reincarnation and the necessity for repetition.  Continuity depends on the “memorial” for which art serves as <em>sine qua non.  </em>From the poetic elegy and other elegiacal writing to sculpture, the funerary arts including urns and textile, and the requiem to the posthumous portrait, art and memory act as respective substituents that circulate in resistance to the finite and celebrate continuity achieved, collective and individual.  From mourning jewelry and wardrobes to repurposed found objects, historical preservation, and gentrification, all give form to <em>lacrimae rerum,</em> the tears of things – those scenes of fallen Troy that Aeneas glimpses on Carthaginian walls in Virgil’s epic.  Whether Wordsworthian “emotion recollected in tranquillity” or legacies outside ourselves that we inherit, memory and civilization, ritual and mythology, become the religion of secular life in all its sanctity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ceramicist/memoirist Edmund de Waal writes, “It is not just things that carry stories with them.  Stories are a kind of thing, too.  Stories and objects share something, a patina.”  Religion creates a vitrine for holding memory, history, narrative, and identity.  It showcases them, potentiating both gaze and tactile engagement.  Memory praxis sanctifies and sacramentalizes the mundane.  As memory studies have expanded to postmemory and even prosthetic memory, art and/as religion are conjoined.  Memory is queer art that is distinct from biological begetting as Platonic spiritual procreation.  The art-ificial line of descent or shared community of belonging makes all work of memory creative.  We re-member that which is lost or subject to time, the literal and figurative cultural production of making something of the past, one’s own or otherwise. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We seek innovative explorations of the relationship between memory, the arts of all kinds, and religion understood both traditionally and counterintuitively.  Digital memory and creation, photography/videography, secularism reconceived through material culture, and new rituals for remembrance will be considered.  Public and private, ordained and vernacular, means of memory are within this scope.  We solicit articles and reviews comparative and particular; on western and nonwestern topics; and engaging various subjects such as gender, sexuality, collective/individual, institutional/innovative, ritual.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Essays should be 5000-10,000 words in length and must be submitted by June 1, 2024 for consideration.  Please direct queries to <a href="mailto:frederick.roden@uconn.edu">frederick.roden@uconn.edu</a>.  <em>Religion and the Arts</em> follows MLA style.   Authors should send any image files in color or black/white as 300 dpi for photography/600 for linework at the size the images are to be reproduced.  Authors must arrange for world rights and are responsible for the costs (the print run is 250).  For further information on <em>Religion and the Arts</em>, edited by James Najarian, consult <a href="https://www.bc.edu/publications/relarts/about.html">https://www.bc.edu/publications/relarts/about.html</a> </p>

(Re)Making Gendered Identities</p>
<p dir="ltr">Editors: Iqra Shagufta Cheema and Sabah Firoz Uddin</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In this edited volume, we invite scholarly essays that examine the relationship between gender and Muslim identities as it is (re)presented in political spaces, visual cultures, and sociopolitical discourses. Some of the questions this volume seeks to examine are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How is the idea of gender mobilized to in/de/form Muslim identities, both within and outside Muslim communities?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In what ways do Muslims contest, resist, and negotiate their gendered identities in relation with the proscribed notions of Muslimness?</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">How do conversations about gender and its performance influence and/or are influenced by the dominant religious and cultural discourses, both in the Global North and the Global South?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Political spaces and cultural conversations are rife with anti-Muslim sentiments as well as negotiation of Muslim identity itself (Abdul Khabeer 2016, Shehabuddin 2021). Muslim women and non-binary individuals are particularly subject to these identitarian interrogations of who is a Muslim. However, rather than retreating from these spaces and conversations, they are increasingly engaging in acts of resistance that, in turn, trigger gendered and racialized reactions (Bouclin 2013, Ali 2022, Islam 2023). This volume brings together scholars who center gender in their analysis of Muslim-led counterpublics to illuminate how Muslims are negotiating religious, cultural and ideological (re)presentations of gender in public and private spaces (Asen 2000). Overall, this volume examines the role of gender – as it functions and is understood within and outside of Muslim communities – in the negotiation of Muslim identities in the global context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We particularly invite contributions from minority Muslim sects, identities, and communities. Please email your 250 word long abstracts and a short bio to <a href="mailto:gender.muslim@gmail.com">gender.muslim@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Suggested topics for chapters include but are not limited to the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Muslims beyond the gender binary</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Piety and its inward and outward performance</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">

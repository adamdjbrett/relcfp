						<description>Publication Name: Existential Philosophy and Disability (collected volume)<br/><br/><p>Call for contributions for a collected volume</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Disability is a significant part of the experience of being human. As the World Health Organisation acknowledges: “Almost everyone will temporarily or permanently experience disability at some point in their life [and an] estimated 1.3 billion people—about 16% of the global population—currently experience disability.”<a name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>As a concept, the understanding of disability has been shifting over the past decades from medical models based on impairment, defect or deficit in the individual, to the social models upheld by the 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, recognising that “disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.”<a name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

<p>Despite these facts, disability remains largely ignored and stigmatised both in general discourse and in academic research outside of the recent field of Disability Studies. While accessibility policies and plans have been developed in many countries, persons with disabilities continue to face discrimination, stigmatisation, and the effects of ableism in all aspects of life, including access to health care and support, education and the protection of their fundamental human rights, leading to negative life outcomes and life expectancies.<a name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>Outside of recent disability rights movements, disability is generally viewed as something negative, a disorder to be repaired. Yet as Elizabeth Barnes has noted: “being disabled is not something that by itself or intrinsically makes you worse off. Being disabled is…a way of being a minority with respect to one’s body, just as being gay is a way of being a minority with respect to sexuality. It is something that makes you different from the majority, but that difference isn’t by itself a bad thing.”<a name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>

<p>One of the most serious challenges faced by persons with disabilities today is the lack of understanding, appreciation and acceptance of these different ways of being human, experiencing life and interacting, with regard to physical, mental, cognitive, sensory, and other health differences. This volume aims to make a positive contribution by engaging issues surrounding disability with perspectives from existential philosophy. Existential philosophy, broadly understood, places the focus on the individual and on the precedence of existence over essence, on the lived, subjective experience of the individual, rejecting metaphysical and universalist views on human nature and the human condition. As such, it may provide a path to better understand the plurality of human experience and existence conditions. At the same time, many of the traditional themes of existential philosophy, such as choice, freedom, and authentic selfhood, may need to be re-examined in light of the specific difficulties and challenges presented to persons with minority bodies, minds, modes of communication, or experiences in a world where social norms and institutions entail direct and indirect discrimination.</p>

<p>Existential philosophy suggests that we are what we are in the eyes or gaze of others (Sartre) or through our acts of disclosure in the world (Beauvoir), or perhaps through the shared language games through which meaning is created (Wittgenstein). But what does this entail for individuals with minority bodies, experiences or realities, and whose experiences may be stigmatised, misunderstood or invalidated by the general community? Do cognitive, intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities or differences represent challenges to authentic self-disclosure in a world that pathologizes difference and in which the language for self-understanding and communication with others, as well as an understanding and appreciation of these differences, may be lacking? </p>

<p>Do the concepts of existential philosophy have something to contribute to discussions about disability rights, identity and pride? Are some founding existential concepts, such as freedom and authenticity, potentially misguided regarding certain persons’ experiences? How do specific conditions or disabilities impact individuals’ life choices and potential, their identity and autonomy? Can existential philosophy provide new perspectives to promote the recognition, respect and appreciation of difference and diversity? And in what ways does rethinking human existence through the lens of disability call into question some of the potentially still essentialist (as well as ableist) views of human nature inherent in existential philosophy?</p>

<p>This volume seeks to broaden our philosophical understanding of disability, moving beyond traditional questions in bioethics, to perspectives on the specific lived experience of persons with disabilities. Contributions engaging with any specific form of disability, as well as more general contributions on disability and ableism that engage with perspectives from existential philosophy and phenomenology (such as Albert Camus, Theodor Adorno, Emil Cioran, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Jaspers, Hannah Arendt, Martin Heidegger and Ludwig Wittgenstein, and their nineteenth-century predecessors [Kierkegaard, Nietzsche…]) are welcome. <em>Contributions from scholars with disabilities are particularly welcome</em>.</p>

<p><strong><u>MARCELA GARCÍA-ROMERO</u></strong></p>
<p>Professor Marcela García-Romero was born and raised in Mexico City. She earned a BA in Philosophy at the <em>University of Navarre</em>, Spain. She received her PhD in Philosophy in 2008 from the <em>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität</em> in Munich, Germany, where she then worked as assistant professor. In 2012, she returned to Mexico to teach at <em>Universidad Iberoamericana</em>. From 2014 to 2016 she was a full-time research fellow at the Institute for Philosophical Research in<em> Mexico's National University</em> (<em>UNAM</em>). Before coming to LMU, she was a researcher and professor at <em>UNAM</em> and at <em>Universidad Michoacana</em> in Morelia, Mexico, where she coordinated the PhD in Philosophy program. Professor García-Romero's work centers on two main areas of philosophy. One main focus is German idealism, particularly the philosophy of the late Schelling and discussions regarding reality, life, human activity, freedom, and the limits of reason. Her other area of specialization is Ontology, specifically discussions on what it is to be and to exist, and the degree to which our concepts can grasp actual being. Professor García-Romero has published extensively on these topics in German, English and Spanish. She is a member of the editorial board of the academic journal <em>Philosophisches Jahrbuch</em> and a member of the executive committee of the <em>North American Schelling Society</em>. She is currently working on a book project on the late Schelling's reception of Aristotelian metaphysics.</p></description>

<p><em>In Caring for Words in a Culture of Lies</em>, our conference keynote speaker Marilyn McEntyre presents literary art and the study of literature as a form of stewardship. Caring for words is akin, she says, to environmental concern and action, for we hold both language and the land in common. The conference invites presentations and conversations exploring the relations among literature and conservation, of serving together creatively to keep and pass on what has been given to us. Our topic is intentionally broad to encourage engagement across historical periods and genres. We invite professors, graduate and undergraduate students, and scholars from multiple disciplines.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>“</strong><em>A large, almost sacramental sense of the import and efficacy of words can be found in early English usage, where . . . to converse was to foster community, to commune with, to dwell in a place with others. Conversation was understood to be a life-sustaining practice, a blessing, and a craft to be cultivated for the common good.” – </em>Marilyn McEntyre</p>

<p> </p>
<p align="center">May 15-17, 2024 (Ghent University)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2023 marks the 300th anniversary of the publication of the early eighteenth-century book series <em>Cérémonies et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde</em>, a work on all the world’s religions known to Europe at that time and originally published in seven volumes between 1723 and 1737 in Amsterdam. Edited by the exiled French Huguenot Jean Frederic Bernard, the original seven volumes of the <em>Cérémonies </em>knew a vast distribution across European readers in the Netherlands, France, England, and the Holy Roman Empire, among other countries. Its popularity was at least partly due to the impressive set of prints included within the books. After all, the engravings were for the most part manufactured by the exiled Parisian artist, Bernard Picart, who was known as one of Europe’s most distinguished engravers at that time.</p>
<p>More than ten years after the publication of some pioneering studies on the project – <em>Religionsbilder der frühen Aufklärung </em>(2006), <em>The Book That Changed Europe </em>(2010) and <em>The First Global Vision of Religion </em>(2010) – the intriguing ceremonies and customs of the various religions depicted in the books still capture the imagination. This is not only caused by their ingenuity regarding the comparative method of inquiry into religion in general, as earlier research widely acknowledged, but also because of their importance as an early modern compendium of imaging religious ceremonies. After all, as the title already indicates, the <em>Cérémonies </em>discusses global religious ceremonies and customs. It focusses on <em>performing </em>religion, instead of on religion as such. In line with Picart and Bernard’s project, this conference aims to focus on the ways in which early modern Europeans related to religious ceremonies of all kinds, ranging from customs that were familiar to Western Europe’s everyday religious life, to rituals from peoples across the globe that were still rather alien to early modern Europeans.</p>
<p>Largely initiated by a turbulent period of the Reformation and Europe’s imperialist drive, the early modern period witnessed a great growth in religious diversity. Europeans thus encountered a growing number of different religious movements. Hence, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries witnessed a proliferation of treatises that discussed all kinds of European forms of religious worship, as well as an abundance of travelogues and reports by colonial settlers that narrated on the religious practices of 'overseas peoples' in Africa, Asia, and the Americas on the other hand. The social pursuit of knowledge during these previous ages, characteristic of the Enlightenment period, eventually led to the rise of early ethnography and anthropology. In the 18th century, various studies on religious worship around the world of, among others, Nicolas de Nicolay (1567), Theodore de Bry (1590), Thomas Coryate (1611), John Smith (1624), and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1708) grew into general, ethnographic studies of religion as a social and anthropological construct (e.g. Charles de Brosses (1760); Octavien de Guasco (1768)).</p>
<p>The <em>Cérémonies</em> operates as an important intermediary between the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century treaties on religious cults and the subsequent ethnographic and anthropological studies on religion of the eighteenth century. As Picart and Bernard’s focus is entirely on the ways in which ceremonies and customs are <em>performed</em> within the various religions of the world, they simultaneously attribute a high degree of theatricality as well as a certain performativity to religion. By focusing on the explicit, outward dimension of devotion that is expressed through the <em>performance</em> of standardized religious ceremonies and rituals, they utter a profound critique on the ‘manufacturability’ of religion. The inherent theatricality and artificiality of religious rites, however, had been the focus of attention throughout the previous centuries, both among Protestant critics that denounced ceremonial splendor, as well as among Catholic clerics who drew up and canonized the laws and restrictions regarding devotional practices. Consider the anti-clerical Protestant tracts of, for example, William Prynn (1632), or the structured religious regulations for performing Catholic worship of Jean-Jacques Olier (1656), Claude-François Ménestrier and Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, among others (1689).</p>
<p>The focus in the <em>Cérémonies</em> oscillates between a striving for an encyclopedic approach of the world's various religious ceremonies and an ideological critique of the theatricality of religious devotion. Besides the general scholarly intentions and the ideological objectives, economic interest played an increasingly significant part in the studying of religion too. Ethnographic and anthropological depictions of religious ceremonies sold; it seems. As the early eighteenth century saw a proliferation of knowledge production, not least in the field of religion, these types of knowledge became commodities that could be traded, sold, and marketed, and were part of the evolving book industry. The <em>Cérémonies</em> knew a deliberate marketing campaign too, as Bernard heavily relied on Picart’s fame as a popular engraver to set up his project. Through engravers like Picart, Inger Leemans (2010) argues, the European Enlightenment learned to sell itself not only intellectually but also commercially. Correspondingly, not long after the publication of the first French volumes of the <em>Cérémonies</em>, translations in English, Dutch, and German spread across Europe, not least by virtue of Picart’s artisanship.</p>
<p>In a reference to the British anthropologists Alfred Gell, Paola Von Wyss-Giacosa (2019) stresses that Picart’s illustrations must be considered a ‘source of, and target for, social agency’. His imaging of religious ceremonies offered a thought-provoking challenge to the public’s conception of religion; to compare, to ponder, and to raise doubts. Correspondingly, this conference aims to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields to discuss the ways in which early modernity related to <em>performing</em> religious ceremonies and customs across the globe, either in text, print, on stage, or in any other imaginable way. How did early modern Europeans perceive religious rituals practiced in other parts of the world, particularly those in overseas territories? To what extent did early modern knowledge production on religious customs contribute to the development of early anthropology and ethnography in the latter half of the eighteenth century? How did representations of religious rituals either endorse or challenge existing knowledge on various religious practices? In what ways did the early modern period witness a shift toward a more encyclopedic approach to representing the ceremonies and customs of various religions, and how did this reflect broader intellectual trends of the Enlightenment era?</p>

<p><strong>Date of conference:</strong> October 20, 2023</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Invitation: </strong>This virtual conference invites papers to consider medieval practices of identity formation and representations of identity. Examples of possible topics to consider include: How might medieval models of consciously constructed literary character illuminate the constructedness of identity and/or textual representations of identity? How do medieval notions of identity help us to understand it as unstable, contextually contingent, and its categories as mutually constitutive— as a species of performative participation rather than a static possession? Conversely, how might medieval texts work to stabilize or mystify the mutability of identity? We welcome papers that come to these and related questions from a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches and strongly encourage interdisciplinary approaches. Considerations of national, racial, religious, and gender/trans identity are welcome, as are papers concerned with kinship and familial affiliation, class/estate, and the intersections of these forms of identity.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Instructions for submission: </strong>Please send an abstract of no more than 150 words to <a href="mailto:hcush@email.unc.edu">hcush@email.unc.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:mariah_min@brown.edu">mariah_min@brown.edu</a> before the deadline. Include your name, affiliation, email, and pronouns. Please indicate in your submission whether you would like your essay to be considered for inclusion in a possible forum of published essays.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: Phenomenology and the Sciences<br/><br/><p>Call for Papers: Phenomenology and the Sciences: Between Foundation, Clarification, and Material Contributions. <em>Studia Phaenomenologica</em> XXIV (2024)</p>
<p>Guest Editors: Andrea Altobrando and Simone Aurora</p>
<p>EXTENDED DEADLINE: 1 September 2023.</p>
<p>What can phenomenology say nowadays concerning the sciences? Is phenomenology able to provide the ground stone Husserl dreamt of, or, as he himself says in the <em>Crisis</em>, “der Traum ist ausgeträumt”? If this is the case, what is the position that phenomenology can assume towards sciences? Can phenomenology itself be considered as a specific science? Can phenomenology offer any contribution to scientific research, both basic and applied? Should phenomenology be understood as a kind of epistemology? Or is there a specific field of research that pertains specifically to phenomenology and that is not on a pair with epistemological reflection?</p>
<p>From its very beginning, phenomenology has shown a strong connection with scientific thought and the sciences. Husserl’s (more or less orthodox) followers, and, more generally, scientist and philosophers, who have found some kind of inspiration in Husserl’s phenomenological project, have variously tried to implement the idea, according to which phenomenology should prepare the ground, clarify the basic concepts and practices, as well as the relationships between different scientific disciplines. Just to mention some, think of Alfred Schutz for sociology, Hermann Weyl for Physics, Oskar Becker for mathematics and geometry, Ludwig Binswanger and Erwin Straus for psychopathology, Roman Jakobson for linguistics, Aron Gurwitsch for psychology. During the past decades, phenomenological researches have especially been carried out in collaboration with, or within the field, of cognitive sciences, the psy-sciences, and the neurosciences. The foundational task of phenomenology has only seldom been at the center of these researches, though. More recently, phenomenology has been seen as offering important insights and contributions to questions and investigations pertaining physics, as well as a potentially powerful tool to tackle classical epistemological questions, and questions concerning philosophy of science, thus finally opening a new bridge between phenomenology and analytic philosophy beyond the restricted field of philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>All in all, phenomenology is nowadays active in two ways towards the sciences, somehow confirming its hybrid position: on the one hand, phenomenology has a clarificatory task, that is concurrently foundational one; on the other hand, phenomenology is practiced in order to offer insights and, more generally, contributions that allow enlarging knowledge within specific sciences.</p>
<p>The 2024 issue of <em>Studia Phaenomenologica</em> will be devoted to the aforementioned and related questions. We invite scholars to submit contributions that tackle the following issues, and strictly related ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>phenomenological clarification of the concept of science and non-science</li>
<li>phenomenological foundations of specific scientific disciplines</li>
<li>phenomenological contributions to scientific knowledge</li>
<li>phenomenology and epistemology</li>
<li>cases of knowledge transfer between phenomenology and specific scientific disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>Submission Guidelines: https://zetabooks.com/library/journals/studia-phaenomenologica/</p>
<p>The papers should be sent to: submissions@phenomenology.ro (subject title: <em>Studia Phaenomenologica </em>2024)</p></description>

The purpose of these symposiums is to redefine the place of the Ottoman tradition in both the overall scheme of the Islamic sciences and the history of thought in general, in order to contribute to the growing literature on these sciences within Ottoman society. In this context, eight symposiums have been organized so far, focusing on the disciplines of philosophical theology (<em>kalām</em>), jurisprudence (<em>fiqḥ</em>), sufism (<em>taṣawwuf</em>), quranic exegesis (<em>tafsīr</em>), prophetic traditions (<em>ḥadīth</em>), Arabic linguistic sciences (<em>al-ʿulūm al-ʿarabiyya</em>), logic and argumentation theory (<em>man</em><em>ṭ</em><em>iq</em> and <em>munāẓara</em>), and historiography. The output of each symposium has been published as an edited book. The ninth of these symposiums will be about ethics (<em>ʿilm al-akhlāq</em>) in the Ottoman period.</p><p>Ethics as a discipline in the history of Islamic thought, as in other civilizations, relates to the examination of the origin of our behavior which is subject to the predicates of good and bad, the criteria for good and bad, the faculties that occur in the human soul or mind and are accepted as virtue or vice, and virtues and vices that different classes of people need to obtain or refrain from. From the 13th century onward, the field of ethics transformed into a corpus which covers economics and politics, and has dealt with political, economic, and cultural relations beyond individual life. It has also been effective in the development of different perspectives and various understandings of the human being. Considering the long history of the basin of civilization established by Islam, it is clear that contemplation on ethics, which has various stages and forms of expression, is a suitable research area.</p><p>The Ottoman period is privy to a long and rich heritage in which the conceptual repertoire and discussions of the old heritage are kept alive thanks to copied works. On the other hand, intellectual production continued and solutions were offered to social and political problems through original texts, commentaries, and translations. Ottoman writings on ethics , which became evident in the 15th century, acquired its own original qualities in addition to encompassing the heritage of its predecessors. Led by such names as Cemaleddin Aksarayī, Ahmed al-Amāsī, Sinan Pasha, and Kāsım Karahisari,  the venture of Ottoman writings on ethics continued with such scholars as: Idris-i Bitlis, Taşköprülüzāde, Kınalızāde, Pir Muhammed, Celālzāde Mustafa Çelebi, Gelibolulu Āli, Muhyi-i Gülşenī, and Müneccimbaşı Ahmed Dede. It has reached modern times with the works of intellectual and artistic connoisseurs like Yağıkçızâde Mehmet Arif, Ali Seydi, and Ömer Ferit Kam.</p><p>Despite being a vast research area, the Ottoman period, which reflects the contemplation on ethics in Islam with all its richness and originality, has still not been the subject of sufficient examination. In this context, the symposium <em>Ethics in the Ottoman Period</em> will focus on the scholars who dealt with ethics, works on the subject, and problems of the period. The symposium aims to illuminate the works, sources, methods, tendencies, aims, and theories of individual scholars who dealt with ethics on one hand, and to illuminate the principles, various aspects, and stages of the contemplation on ethics in the Ottoman Empire on the other. A holistic evaluation of all these, together with both their theoretical extensions and their application areas throughout history, can only be possible with an interdisciplinary effort that encompasses such sciences as history, jurisprudence, literature, Sufism, theology, philosophy, and medicine.</p><p> </p><p><strong>While not limiting, the titles of the symposium include the following sample themes:</strong></p><p>The scope and main milestones of ethical thought in the Ottoman period</p><p>Possible classifications (chronological, regional, religious, ethnolinguistic, vocational, subject-based, etc.) for ethical texts and authors in the Ottoman period</p><p>Ottoman thinkers' expectancy from ethics and the way they posited this science</p><p>The place of ethics in the classification of sciences</p><p>The relationship of ethics with the other disciplines, such as history, jurisprudence, politics, economics, literature, and Sufism</p><p>Sources used in Ottoman ethical works</p><p>Authoring motivations of Ottoman ethical thinkers and their intellectual traditions</p><p>Types of authoring of ethical works of the Ottoman period</p><p>Translation activities in the context of Ottoman ethical though</p><p> </p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p>After the program, the authors will be given time for the selected papers to be arranged as book chapters and the texts will be published as part of a separate edited book.</p><p>The languages of the symposium to be held in Istanbul are Turkish, Arabic, and English.</p><p>Travel and accommodation expenses of accepted notifiers will be covered.</p><p>Abstracts should be arranged no more than 250 words.</p><p>Abstracts should be sent to <a href="mailto:symposium@isar.org.tr">symposium@isar.org.tr</a> along with the applicants' contact information and academic CVs.</p></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.isar.org.tr/en/symposiums-workshops/ethics-in-the-ottoman-period/call-for-papers-13" target="_blank">https://www.isar.org.tr/en/symposiums-workshops/ethics-in-the-ottoman-period/call-for-papers-13</a></div></div></div></description>

			<title>[ April 15, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Phenomenology and History</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106165</link>
						<description><p>Phenomenology was originally designed to be a science that attempted to overcome particular and accidental determinants. For many scholars, this attempt meant that phenomenology should focus, as some argued, on timeless and non-historical meanings and essences. This reading, however, was misleading and did not do justice to the nuanced way in which “the historical” was approached by Husserl and his followers (and critics). Given a thorough analysis of inner time-consciousness, passive synthesis, and the phenomenon of sedimentation, it became evident that “the historical” is a crucial component not only of the past, but of the very experience of the present.</p>
<p>The phenomenology of history is not only an important part of phenomenological studies, but also opens new perspectives on the history of philosophy, as is the case in the writings of Husserl, Heidegger, Patočka, and Marion, to mention only a few authors. A phenomenological approach to the history of philosophy points out that it is about discovering the “closed-off” dimension of the original philosophical evidence. This is not closed off because the meanings in question are fixed once and for all and are not amenable to any transformation, but because what is at stake is the evidence that internally supported the construction of the philosophical positions of the past, yet at the same time was not exposed in a sufficiently clear and adequate manner. When the philosophical positions of the past were shaped, the evidence that actually motivated and initiated the emergence of certain philosophies remained a sediment that has not yet been reactivated, i.e., brought to itself-givenness in such a way that its crucial effect can be appreciated for what it is. Moreover, being-closed-off as a feature of the original evidence also means that the history of philosophy represents a unique movement. What drove its development over and over again was a <em>telos</em> that was common to all relevant philosophical positions of the past, yet remained closed off within them—which meant that no philosophy was able to realize the <em>telos</em> present in it, a <em>telos</em> to which it owes its legitimation within the historical flow of philosophy.</p>
<p>Unlike Hegel’s notion, the phenomenological notion of teleological history does not rest upon the idea of development: Husserl’s convincing analysis focused on the factual state of philosophical research suggests that history is about the internal breakdown of its guiding idea rather than about a successful and fruitful path to its fulfillment and realization. According to his remark expressed at the beginning of the <em>Crisis</em>, “the whole historical process has a remarkable form, one which become visible only through an interpretation of its hidden innermost motivation. Its form is not that of a smooth development, not that of a continual growth of lasting spiritual acquisitions or of a transformation of spiritual configurations—concepts, theories, systems—which can be explained by means of the accidental historical situations” (<em>Crisis</em>, 11–12).</p>
<p>The thematic scope of the conference will include (but is not limited to) the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Husserl and his followers (and critics) on the history of philosophy;</li>
<li>approaches to history and history of philosophy in the writings of Heidegger, Ingarden, Arendt, Patočka, Carr, and others;</li>

<li>phenomenological methods of exploring the phenomenon of history;</li>
<li>eidos and historical sedimentations in the history of philosophy;</li>

It focuses on African engagements with Islam at these different scales and how such engagements help to shape imagination of the past, present, and future. Such cultural and political imagination can have important implications for African Muslims’ writing of history, their modes of belonging, shifting affiliations, and aspirations for the future. To date, there has been considerable scholarship on how various ethnolinguistic groups (e.g., Swahili) and areas (e.g., the Indian Ocean) in Africa in which Islam and Islamic religious culture feature prominently have been implicated in regional, transregional, and global entanglements across space and time. There is also growing scholarship on Asia-Africa and Middle East-Africa, as well as on shifting geopolitics in a multipolar world. However, broader attempts to conceptualize such transregional and global entanglements beyond such case studies as they relate to Islam and Muslim societies have been rather limited. Given the broader objectives of analytical and comparative reflection about Islam in Africa in global context, presenters will cast new light on African engagements with Islam and some of the transregional and global connections African Muslims have forged, as well as the implications such connections have for understanding Islam in a globalizing world. The panel invites papers dealing with African engagements with Islam at the intersection of the local, the transregional, and the global in various contexts across space and time using historical methods, ethnography, visual culture, and/or media studies.</span></span></p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><span><span><a name="_MailAutoSig"><span><span><span>Mara Leichtman</span></span></span></a></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Associate Professor<br/>Department of Anthropology<br/>Muslim Studies Program<br/>Michigan State University<br/>310 Baker Hall<br/>655 Auditorium Road<br/>East Lansing, MI  48824</span></span></span><br/><u><span><span><span><a href="mailto:maral@msu.edu">maral@msu.edu</a></span></span></span></u>  </span></span></p><p><span><span><a href="https://iupress.org/9780253016010/shii-cosmopolitanisms-in-africa/" rel="nofollow"><span><span><span>Shi'i Cosmopolitanisms in Africa: Lebanese Migration and Religious Conversion in Senegal</span></span></span></a></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:maral@msu.edu">maral@msu.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

Finding this a good occasion to re-visit Troeltsch’s work together with its broader context the Chair for Sociology of Religion at the Pedagogical University of Cracow would like to invite for the international conference <i>The (social) science of religion: Troeltsch, Weber, Simmel and others</i>. The main idea of the conference is to acknowledge and re-consider Troeltsch’s (rarely appreciated) role within the “visionary company” of great social scientists dealing with religion in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. What we attempt is broad and interdisciplinary reflection in which Troeltsch’s theological, philosophical and sociological approach together with the work of his contemporaries constitutes a point of departure. Submissions from sociologists, historians, theologians or philosophers are welcome. Different approaches to the main theme, both appreciative and critical, debates around heritage and questions of possible meanings that the “social science of religion” may have for (and in) our time – all this is of utmost interest to us. The list of possible topics includes:    </span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Troeltsch as a theologian and social scientist. Troeltsch has usually been treated as a theologian only while his contributions to social sciences or philosophy of religion have been overlooked or simply forgotten. But this is as much pigeonholing as treating Weber solely as a “classic of sociology”. In fact what both Troeltsch and Weber offer is a broad synthesis of theology, sociology, history and philosophy.     </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Troeltsch and his contemporaries – mutual inspirations and influences. Troeltsch has long been in the shadow of Weber and only recently was the importance of his work for social sciences and our reflection on modernity re-discovered. The same more or less can be said of Simmel.       </span></span></span></p><p><span><span> - </span></span><span><span><span>Troeltsch’s multidisciplinary “science of religion” among similar projects by Weber, Simmel Durkheim or James.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Visions of modernity and secularization in the writings of Troeltsch, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, Émile Durkheim or William James: parallels and differences.      </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Protestant Reformation in the writings of Troeltsch and Weber. The mutual influence of Troeltsch’s account of the birth of modernity out of the spirit of Protestantism and Weber’s theses about Reformation and capitalism is now indisputable. The question which may be asked today is which of these two accounts seem more relevant and inspiring from today’s perspective.  </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Mutual interactions between theology and social sciences in Troeltsch and other representatives of the “science of religion”.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- Religion, historical consciousness and the question of values in Troeltsch and in the social science of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>- The question of “public function” and political responsibilities of both social science and theology according to Troeltsch, Weber, Simmel or James. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><b>The conference will be held on 1-2 June 2023</b><b> </b>at the Pedagogical University of Cracow in Cracow, Poland.

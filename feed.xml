Taken broadly, the terms relate to goodness and badness, righteousness and evil, morality and depravity, inculcation and elimination. In each of these conjunctions, conflict stands at the forefront. Similar tensions manifest across theory and lived experience, from disagreement and wars to schisms and debates on the very existence of God. The interplay of vice, virtue, and conflict, then, occasions inquiry into the facets of life in a broken world and faith in the One who alone is perfect. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>With this topic in mind, we</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>invite undergraduate and graduate students, as well as early-career post-docs, to submit to </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Theophron</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>’s spring 2023 issue.

<p>Religions invites submissions for a special journal issue that will examine the contemporary function and presence of religion in the lives of African Americans. Taking its cue from the journal title itself—religions—this special issue welcomes contributions with multidisciplinary approaches that consider “religion” as both a literal set of practices and value systems that anchor various spiritual, philosophical and cultural beliefs, and as an organizational tool that mobilizes communities for political and social change. As the gospel according to Common states, “the movement is a rhythm to us/freedom is like religion to us.”  Given the wide-range of topics and time-periods that could be discussed under this heading, specific attention will be given to papers that examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sermon as social catalyst</li>
<li>Religion as wellness</li>
<li>Faith and the African American community</li>
<li>Gender and sexuality and African American religion</li>
<li>Religion as theme in African American literature</li>
<li>Sacred and secular in African American music</li>
<li>Political movements and African American religion</li>
<li>Religion and African American Film</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstracts of 500 words should be submitted to special issue editor, Dr. Carol E. Henderson at <a href="mailto:carol.e.henderson@emory.edu">carol.e.henderson@emory.edu</a> by December 1, 2022. Completed and accepted papers of 7,500 to 15,000 words (excluding notes) should be submitted using the journal’s submission system by March 30, 2023.</p>
<p>All submissions must contain original unpublished work not being considered for publication elsewhere. All essays are peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>For more information, please see <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/religions/special_issues/2US4YUDLG0">https://www.mdpi.com/journal/religions/special_issues/2US4YUDLG0</a></p>

			<title>[ November 23, 2022] CFP for conference or similar: Tyndale Fellowship's Study Group in Philosophy of Religion</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/103982</link>
						<description><p>The Tyndale Fellowship plans to meet (in person) Wednesday 5th July 14:00 – Friday 7 July 2023 14:00 at <strong>High Leigh Conference Centre, Hoddesdon (</strong><a href="https://www.cct.org.uk/high-leigh/high-leigh-conference-centre">https://www.cct.org.uk/high-leigh/high-leigh-conference-centre</a>).</p>
<p>We are very pleased that Dr Paul Gould (<a href="https://www.paul-gould.com/about/">https://www.paul-gould.com/about/</a>) of Palm-Beach University, Florida, has agreed to be our Tyndale Lecturer; title and topic to be confirmed. </p>
<p>Booking is not open yet, but we hope that it will open on <strong>2nd December</strong>. Early-bird booking is expected to finish on<strong> 31st January</strong>. We expect that bursaries will be available, on the basis of need, for those struggling to raise the funds to travel to Hoddesdon.</p>
<p>If you'd like to give us a paper, please send an <strong>abstract</strong> (no precise word limit: aim for 250 words or so) to <a href="mailto:djhill1972@gmail.com">djhill1972@gmail.com</a> by <strong>23rd November</strong>. (The paper itself should be aimed to last for about <strong>30 minutes</strong>.) The abstract can be on any area of philosophy of religion, broadly construed. We are happy to receive submissions from any stream of philosophy (analytical, continental, historical, feminist...) and from people of any faith or none. If you do not expect to be able to be present in person please feel free to submit an abstract <em>making it clear that you are able to present only on-line</em>. Equally, it'd be helpful if you can confirm that you expect to be in person, if that is the case. We intend to give preference for in-person talks, but may, as this year, be able to accommodate a couple of on-line talks.</p>
<p>Any queries, please contact Daniel Hill at djhill1972@gmail.com. </p></description>

His earlier work has engaged with how Christian groups in the Middle East have enforced boundaries with other populations, both other Christians and with pagans, Jews and Muslims. In particular, he has examined the way that history writing has functioned as an identitarian discourse, which legitimated social boundaries in the present by referring to an idealised representation of the past.</p><p>The <em>Group Formation </em>project seeks to understand how ethnic and religious communities have maintained their distinctiveness over time, or failed to do so. It aims to compare Jewish, Christian and Muslim populations across Iraq and the Levant to isolate the factors that allowed some groups to survive and flourish while others did not. Previous literature on this subject has tended to approach these issues through the rate of conversion to Islam. While this is an important viewpoint, this project focusses instead on the factors that allowed a group to retain coherence in a multicultural society, on how its leaders could maintain separation from outsiders while still gaining trust and acceptance from the Abbasid state.</p><p><strong>Speaker</strong><br/>Philip Wood is the inaugural Tejpar Professor of Inter-Religious Studies at the Aga Khan University's Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilisations (AKU-ISMC), London, and a historian of Christians in the medieval Middle East, c.500-1000. He is also interested in issues of contemporary social integration and religious education.

Glasgow, Sheryl Petty, Aishah Shahidah Simmons, and Laurie Amodeo</p><p><strong>Honoring Ancestors in Black Buddhist Practice: Rituals of Devotion and Resilience</strong><br/>Rima Vesely-Flad<br/><em>This article examines how Black Buddhists have embraced ancestral practices as they elaborate dharma teachings in convert Buddhist communities. Such practices include storytelling, devotional bowing, drumming, dancing, and chanting, as well as honoring African-derived images and ancestors on Buddhist altars. This article emphasizes the importance of honoring ancestors and the land within different lineages, as well as practices for incorporating indigenous rituals into Buddhist practices. For indigenous-oriented Buddhist practitioners, the history of ancestors carries meaning for themselves, their family members, and their broader community. Furthermore, the courage, determination, and perseverance embodied by ancestors is mirrored in the resilience of the land to withstand natural forces. Even when African Americans acknowledge their complex relationship with the land of the United States—land they were violently made to work as enslaved peoples to garner profits for white slaveowners—they acknowledge the importance of feeling located on land and the presence of First Nation peoples who populated the land prior to colonization. The ability to see the land as sacred, beyond the history of European colonialism, has been incorporated into numerous African-American healing initiatives.</em></p><p><strong>For Grandma, Pain as a Teacher</strong><br/>Chris Lang</p><p><strong>Of Color-Confrontation and Consumption: Black and Buddhist Insights into Racism</strong><br/>David Salisbury Brown Mitchell<br/><em>Functional racism is viewed as the consumptive force of White supremacy which counteracts the persistent fear of being annihilated by the Other. Manifestations of that fear, as well as ancient and modern attempts to identify and ameliorate it are considered. We begin by considering the potential roots of racism through Welsing’s Cress Theory of Color-Confrontation and Racism, then discuss Woodard’s treatment of consumption and parasitism during chattel slavery as well as the hungry ghost, or preta, in Buddhist thought and its unending appetite. Last, we consider modern and ancient means of recognizing and allaying racism-as-fear-of-death primarily through the work of Shulman on mindfulness and impermanence, Menakem on the “soul nerve,” and ancient Kemetic philosophy on Ma’at and the Ausarian drama. <strong>Keywords:</strong> functional racism, color-confrontation theory, consumption, hungry ghost, Kemet, death anxiety</em></p><p><strong>“Buddhish” Not Buddhist: Womanist Reflections on My Journey Towards Buddhism</strong><br/>Arisika Razak<br/><em>Alice Walker’s womanist definition celebrates the embodied spiritual culture, diverse sexualities, and leadership abilities of Black women. Several of these traits are found in the self-identified Black female preachers and freedom fighters of the 19th century. While there are numerous varieties of Buddhism, the Western, Theravada, meditation-based convert Buddhism brought back to the USA by Euro-American converts in the 1960’s has emphasized intellectual studies and silent meditation. These methodologies can be seen as oppositional to West African Diasporic cultural norms which privilege voice, movement, and physical embodiment, as well as women’s authority in the outer world. This essay explores some of the ways in which contemporary Black Buddhist teachers have begun to integrate African Diasporic norms into their Buddhist teachings. It also chronicles some of the struggles, connections and contradictions that I found as I tried to integrate my womanist self into my Buddhist practice</em></p><p><strong>Africana Yogi Personae: Black Women Yoga Practitioners’ Aesthetic Negotiations in Dress</strong><br/>Sha’mira Covington &amp; Carolyn Medine<br/><em>Western conceptions of the typical yoga practitioner envision her as a skinny, white, and often upper-class woman. If one searches for images of “yoga” or attempts to purchase yoga clothing online, visual representations overwhelmingly feature thin, able-bodied white women in acrobatic poses. These images perpetuate dominant Eurocentric standards of beauty which stem from colonization and white supremacy. This study aims to illuminate the voices of Black women yoga practitioners in the southern U.S. and investigate their aesthetic negotiations in dress. Using participant observation, qualitative interviews and autoethnographic methods, the first author inquires into the yoga and dress practices of five contemporary Black women yoga practitioners, as well as her own, to explore some of the aesthetic negotiations of dress for marginalized bodies in yoga spaces. The study examines the linkages between dress practices, acculturation strategies, and cultural identity by drawing on decolonization theory to shift marginalized voices to the center, the aesthetics of dress to highlight the role of dress in the creation and assertion of Black identity, and womanism to center the experiences, needs and thoughts of Black women. <strong>Keywords:</strong> Black women, yoga, decolonization, womanism, dress, embodiment</em></p><p><strong>Remember black run ‘cross my hips</strong><br/>Raquel Baker</p><p><strong>Transcending Internalized Racism with the Perfection of Resolve, Generosity, and Wisdom</strong><br/>Kamilah Majied<br/><em>Internalized racism can combine with natural human tendencies towards greed, envy and jealousy to limit the intrapersonal and interpersonal freedom of Black people. This short essay discusses practicing resolve and generosity to cultivate wisdom as a means by which Black people can experience abundance and absolute freedom. <strong>Keywords: </strong>internalized racism, greed, resolve, generosity, wisdom, freedom</em></p><p><strong>The Karma of Slavery: A Rumination</strong><br/>Tracy Watson<br/><em>American slavery is easily characterized as the most horrific act of inhumanity committed in this country’s history, second only to the attempted genocide of Native American identity and peoples. My family contains both histories. And I have struggled to humanistically confront the legacy of racialized violence bequeathed to my people. After more than 30 years of practicing Nichiren Buddhism, I began an exploration of my feelings on the subject, hoping to find answers to questions that have plagued me for most of my practice. The following essay is a chronicle of my attempt to confront my questions about the “karma of slavery” (and the ongoing legacy of it) and my efforts to transform the effect of that karma in my life, based on Nichiren Buddhism. I begin my essay with a brief introduction to the origins of my Buddhist practice. I then introduce two principles that are essential to Buddhism: the concepts of “fundamental darkness” (and how it relates to my life in particular) and “fundamental enlightenment” or universal “Buddhahood”. To expound the concept of fundamental enlightenment or Buddhahood, I explicate what is meant in Nichiren Buddhism by the term “Buddha” and the Buddha vow.</em></p><p><strong>ASÉ / Vital Energy</strong><br/>shah noor hussein</p><hr/><p>Artwork by Star Barker, Cheryl Derricotte, and authors</p><hr/><p><em>Note: A correction was made to the issue file on October 5, 2022.

<p> </p>
<p>Under the aegis of transnationalism and purposefully looking for interconnectedness and exchange of ideas, we are inviting contributions for a forthcoming book focusing on Sci-Fi literature from India and Canada and their renditions of religious themes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scholars working on or interested in Canadian and/or Indian Sci-Fi literature are invited to consider the topic of religion from a variety of perspectives. The book will ask and (hopefully) answer questions related to the status of religion in Sci-Fi literature from a postcolonial angle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the words of Jessica Langer, “[t]he figure of the alien comes to signify all kinds of otherness, and the image of the far-away land, whether the undiscovered country or the imperial seat, comes to signify all kinds of diaspora and movement, in all directions.” (Langer, 2011: 4)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore, we are inviting contributions which could also make the transition from the real historic past of India and Canada to the fictional worlds depicted by Sci-Fi authors from the respective countries. A complete disconnection of reality and fiction is also a topic of interest for the present book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As former British colonies, India and Canada have a shared history of stifling religious diversity in colonized territories by the colonizers and afterwards consolidating on diversity of faiths, especially after Canada and India declared their independence. One of the research purposes of the present volume is to discover whether the postcolonial histories of Canada and India are traceable in Sci-Fi literature’s treatment of religious themes. Is Sci-Fi literature mirroring the postcolonial condition of both India and Canada? Have religions/ faiths been instrumental in establishing a pristine/out-of-history background in Sci-Fi texts? Are Canadian and Indian Sci-Fi writers offering solutions for a ‘de-colonized’ frame of mind or, on the contrary, are their texts reproducing a colonialist impetus which extends to the outer space? Is religion (with all its possible facets, institutional, spiritual, etc.) or absence of religion an instrument of power in Sci-Fi literature? These are only a few suggested research directions that the forthcoming book will dwell on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The volume will have a few main strands on which interested authors can bring their contribution:</p>
<p>            - Defining and redefining religions and religious institutions in Indian and/or Canadian Sci-Fi literature;</p>
<p>            - Politics and religion in Indian and/or Canadian Sci-Fi literature (religious wars; religion as activism/ propaganda (e.g.: for space colonization));</p>
<p>- Absence of religions and their institutions in Indian and/or Canadian Sci-Fi literature (replacement of religion/ re-inventing or creating new religions/faiths; science as religion).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Possible themes (but not restricted to these)</strong></p>
<p>Apocalyptic futures</p>
<p>Religion and utopias/ dystopias/ New religions/ Alien faiths and religions</p>
<p>Religious symbols and supernatural beings (gods/angels/demons/saints)</p>
<p>(New) Creationist mythologies</p>
<p>Cyborgs and other beings/ New (transgender) beings and species and their faiths</p>
<p>Ethics, faith and religion – robots, AI and other sentient beings</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suggested Canadian Sci-Fi writers (not restricted to)</strong></p>

<p>William Gibson</p>

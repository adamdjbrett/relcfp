Recently this has emerged as an important framework for interdisciplinary engagement about enhanced cognitive performance. While presented as a binary in classical accounts—as if effort is a fixed and static quantity that is present or absent—it is better understood as a descriptive framework for a spectrum of contemplative dynamics that unfold during meditative experiences, and which can be intentionally enacted, or fostered, by different contemplative techniques. These practices are performed in ongoing and dynamic shifts across a spectrum of intensities of effort.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>The symposium promises to catalyze transdisciplinary research collaborations to advance a collective understanding of the underlying dynamics of contemplative practices. We are bringing together leading specialists for an exploration of these practices in light of contemporary philosophical inquiry and psychological research on effort and effortless, self-emergent experiences. Themes of effortlessness and self-emergence in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist contemplative practices will be addressed in four overlapping domains: (I) Cognitive Effort and Control Practices, (II) Nondual Awareness Practices, (III) Dream and Illusion Practices. (IV) Self-Emergent Visionary Practices. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Each domain will involve a creative mix of Buddhist Studies scholars, scientists, philosophers, teacher-practitioners, and experts in the arts and technology with distinct bodies of expertise – textual, experiential, and empirical.</span></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span><span><span><span>Participants</span></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span><span><span><span>Session I: Cognitive Effort and Control Practices</span></span></span></span></strong></p><ol><li><span><span><span><span><span>Zac Irving (Philosophy), University of Virginia </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Sonam Kachru (Buddhist Studies), Yale University </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Chandra Sripada (Psychiatry), University of Michigan </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Karin Meyers (Practitioner), Mangalam Research Center </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Georges Dreyfus (Buddhist Studies), Williams College</span></span></span></span></span></li></ol><p><strong><span><span><span><span>Session II: Nondual Awareness Practices</span></span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></strong></p><ol><li><span><span><span><span><span>John Dunne (Buddhist Studies), University of Wisconsin-Madison </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Cat Prueitt (Buddhist Studies), University of British Columbia </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Antoine Lutz (Neuroscience), University of Lyon, France </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Willa Miller (Practitioner), Natural Dharma Fellowship </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Bryce Huebner (Philosophy) Georgetown University</span></span></span></span></span></li></ol><p><strong><span><span><span><span>Session III: Dream and Illusion Practices</span></span></span></span></strong></p><ol><li><span><span><span><span><span>Michael Sheehy (Buddhist Studies), University of Virginia </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Jake Dalton (Buddhist Studies), University of California-Berkeley </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Andrew Holocek (Practitioner), Edge of Mind </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Ken Paller (Neuroscience), Northwestern University </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Melanie Boly (Neuroscience), University of Wisconsin-Madison </span></span></span></span></span></li></ol><p><strong><span><span><span><span>Session IV: Self-Emergent Visionary Practices</span></span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></strong></p><ol><li><span><span><span><span><span>David Germano (Buddhist Studies), University of Virginia  </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Per Sederberg (Neuroscience), University of Virginia </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>James Gentry (Buddhist Studies), Stanford University </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Anne Klein (Practitioner), Rice University </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Dave Glowacki (Technology), CiTIUS Intelligent Technologies Research Centre, Spain </span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Susan Magsamen (Neuroaesthetics), Johns Hopkins University </span></span></span></span></span></li></ol><p><span><span><span>This is an in-person public event designed to foster dialogue with an international community of specialists.

Taken broadly, the terms relate to goodness and badness, righteousness and evil, morality and depravity, inculcation and elimination. In each of these conjunctions, conflict stands at the forefront. Similar tensions manifest across theory and lived experience, from disagreement and wars to schisms and debates on the very existence of God. The interplay of vice, virtue, and conflict, then, occasions inquiry into the facets of life in a broken world and faith in the One who alone is perfect.</p><p>With this topic in mind, we invite undergraduate and graduate students, as well as early-career post-docs, to submit to Theophron’s spring 2023 issue. Scholarship from all fields, particularly philosophy, theology, history, and biblical studies, is welcome.</p><p>Possible topics include but are certainly not limited to:</p><ul><li><p>●  Epistemology of Religious or Moral Disagreement</p></li><li><p>●  Virtue’s Role in Christian Discipleship across Traditions</p></li><li><p>●  Prophetic &amp; Apostolic Responses to Political-Religious Tensions</p></li><li><p>●  Moral Arguments for God’s Existence</p></li><li><p>●  Interpretations of Old Testament Conflict Narratives</p></li><li><p>●  Just War Theory &amp; Pacifism in World War II</p></li><li><p>●  Early Church Understandings of Spiritual Conflict</p></li><li><p>●  Historical Christian Responses to Global Strife</p></li><li><p>●  Metaethics and Theories of Sin</p></li><li><p>●  Protestant, Catholic, &amp; Orthodox Views of Vice</p><p>Submission Instructions<br/>Submissions should be between 4,000–6,500 words (not including abstract), conform to the Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition), and be original, unpublished works prepared for double- blind peer review.

Researchers and politicians are analyzing the events of the past 20 years, trying to see retrospectively the key moments and signs that had predetermined the current development of the situation. Analyses of Putin's rhetoric, the memory politics of the Great Patriotic War in Russia, and the formation of the Russian lobby in the West are all becoming the subject of intense academic debate.</p><p>Likewise, the internal Ukrainian processes – the reactions of society and the state to the challenges of Russian aggression – arouse more and more research interest from various aspects. Russia's war against Ukraine has had the most dramatic impact on the lives of Ukrainians: tens of thousands killed and wounded, millions of refugees and internally displaced persons, economic paralysis, and enormous damage to infrastructure. Experts agree that it will take decades to overcome the various destructive consequences of the war. At the same time, they acknowledge that the war had a significant impact on the values and identity of Ukrainians, becoming a catalyst for the formation of the Ukrainian nation and horizontal ties, rethinking established social, gender, and other roles. These macro-social processes are already the subject of research by anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, and other scholars.</p><p>This workshop will examine how the war affected Ukraine's ethno-religious minorities, their identities, religious and cultural practices, and value orientations. We invite abstracts focusing on the transformations in the life of ethno-religious minorities after the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, and, in particular, after the full-scale Russian offensive in February 2022. The list of topics for discussion is not limited to the following:</p><p>- Identity, intragroup dynamics, and value orientations of ethno-religious minorities in Ukraine under conditions of war.</p><p>- Russia's war in Ukraine and ethno-religious minorities' migration and displacement.</p><p>- Religious affiliation and connections to transnational religious networks and Ukrainian minorities' migration trajectories.</p><p>- Religious and cultural practices of ethno-religious minorities in Ukraine and their transformations after 2014.</p><p>- Digitalization of religious and cultural practices of ethno-religious minorities in Ukraine in war-divided communities.</p><p>- Ukrainian ethno-religious minorities participation in the war: mobilization, narratives, resources.</p><p>- Intercultural communication in war, majority-minority relations, etc.</p><p>This project aims to produce a collective volume on the war in Ukraine and its impact on ethno-religious minorities in the region. We see its implementation as a two-stage process. In the first stage, we will organize a workshop at the European Center for Minority Issues (ECMI) in Flensburg, Germany, in May 2023 to gather experts in the field. The ECMI will cover the travel expenses and accommodation of the experts during the workshop. In the second stage, we plan to publish an edited volume on ethno-religious minorities in Ukraine during the war.</p><p>The ECMI is co-editing a book series devoted to minority studies entitled Routledge Advances in Minority Studies (RAMS), where the collection will be hosted. Publication of the volume is scheduled for late 2023 – early 2024. We invite researchers to send an abstract for proposed papers (250–300 words) and a short bio-note (max. 100 words) by 20 March 2023 to: <a href="mailto:nadia.zasanska@uni-flensburg.de">nadia.zasanska@uni-flensburg.de</a> and <a href="mailto:murelmira@aias.au.dk">murelmira@aias.au.dk</a>. More detailed information on papers including a style guide will be sent at a later stage. Complete papers of about 6,000 – 8,000 words should be submitted by 29 September 2023.</p><p>Workshop convenors:</p><p>Dr. habil.

			<title>[ June 8, 2023 -  June 10, 2023] Conference or similar: Phenomenology: Linguistic or Eidetic?</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107550</link>
						<description>Venue: Universitätsplatz 3<br/><br/><p>The alternative alluded to in the conference title is that between what J. L. Austin called "linguistic phenomenology" (Philosophical Papers, p. 182), broadly conceived as synonymous with "ordinary language philosophy (= OLP), and phenomenology as founded by Edmund Husserl. In this later sense, "phenomenology" is meant to include figures like Eugen Fink, Adolf Reinach or Merleau-Ponty, but also influential secessionists like Heidegger or Derrida. The former tradition is understood as including the likes of Wittgenstein, Ryle, Alan R. White or Cavell. Papers will either cut across the traditions or be basic in a way that makes them relevant for both of them. The following topics have been suggested for discussion:<br/><br/>(1) “S is p” – A Basic Structure of Judgement?<br/><br/>(2) The “Natural Attitude” vs. the Ordinary<br/><br/>(3) Transcendental Subjectivity vs. the “We” of OLP<br/><br/>(4) Voice and Subjectivity<br/><br/>(5) The Inner and the Outer</p>
<p>The first half-day (starting on Thursday, 8 June 2023, 3:30 pm) will be a hybrid event. On Friday and Saturday, the workshop will be held in presence only. No formal registration is required, but let me know if you wish to attend by sending an email to bernhard.ritter AT uni-graz.at</p></description>

			<title>[ June 26, 2023 -  June 30, 2023] Conference or similar: Gratitude</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107570</link>
						<description>Venue: 1235 University Blvd<br/><br/><p>In this seminar we will explore gratitude as a fundamental moral disposition without which no one can really be happy. <br/>Our culture today is fraught by questions about gratitude. How do we receive in gratitude the goods of our own traditions despite their evils, of which we are increasingly aware? Can we cultivate gratitude in a social-media world of envy, isolation, and self-assertion? Why should we be grateful in the midst of great suffering?<br/><br/>In this seminar, we will attempt to answer these questions and to offer gratitude as an antidote to other challenges, such as feelings of loneliness, resentment, envy, and the self-hatred that oppresses so many today. We will show how gratitude guards against despair, and resists the nihilist attitude that fails to see the value of anything.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we will propose gratitude as an essential condition of human happiness and human flourishing.  In so doing, we will explore the relations between gratitude and contemplation, stewardship, and material creation; between gratitude and wonder, creativity, and invention; between gratitude and beauty, hope, and joy; and between gratitude, self-love, and the love of God.   The seminar will draw on ideas in from the history of philosophy, medieval philosophy, contemporary virtue theory, phenomenology, and personalism, as well as aesthetics and poetics.   Several keynote addresses will be given by <br/><br/>—John F. Crosby, Professor Emeritus at Franciscan University and author of The Selfhood of the Human Person and The Personalism of John Henry Newman<br/>—Jonathan J. Sanford, President at the University of Dallas, author of Before Virtue: Assessing Contemporary Virtue Ethics<br/>—Mark Spencer, professor at the University of St. Thomas (MN), author of The Irreducibility of the Human Person: A Catholic Synthesis <br/>—James Matthew Wilson, Professor in the MFA program at University of St. Thomas (Houston), author of The Vision of the Soul: Truth, Goodness, and Beauty in the Western Tradition<br/><br/>A full list of faculty can be found on the event website.  </p>

			<title>[ April 22, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Shaikh al-Ishraq and the Modern World</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107542</link>
						<description><p>The Institute of Suhrawardi’s Wisdom in collaboration with some academic centers organizes an international conference to reread the thoughts of Shaikh al-Ishraq. Rereading Suhrawardi's thoughts is of great importance for the new generation who live in a different world from Suhrawardi's time. There is no need to say that in this rereading, due to the critical nature of the modern world, there may be some criticisms of those ideas. This international conference, which will be held in person and online in March 2023, originates from the view that original premodern intellectual traditions can be the source of insight and inspiration for contemporary human being in solving his/her complicated problems.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: EXTENDED: Vice, Virtue, &amp; Conflict (Theophron Spring 2023)<br/><br/><p>Taken narrowly, vice and virtue comprise both central considerations of virtue ethical theories and peripheral considerations of any sophisticated normative ethics—that is, all plausible normative ethics will comment on vice and virtue in some manner. Taken broadly, the terms relate to goodness and badness, righteousness and evil, morality and depravity, inculcation and elimination. In each of these conjunctions, conflict stands at the forefront. Similar tensions manifest across theory and lived experience, from disagreement and wars to schisms and debates on the very existence of God. The interplay of vice, virtue, and conflict, then, occasions inquiry into the facets of life in a broken world and faith in the One who alone is perfect.</p>
<p>With this topic in mind, we invite undergraduate and graduate students, as well as early-career post-docs, to submit to Theophron’s spring 2023 issue. Scholarship from all fields, particularly philosophy, theology, history, and biblical studies, is welcome.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are certainly not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>●  Epistemology of Religious or Moral Disagreement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Virtue’s Role in Christian Discipleship across Traditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Prophetic &amp; Apostolic Responses to Political-Religious Tensions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Moral Arguments for God’s Existence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Interpretations of Old Testament Conflict Narratives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Just War Theory &amp; Pacifism in World War II</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Early Church Understandings of Spiritual Conflict</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Historical Christian Responses to Global Strife</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Metaethics and Theories of Sin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Protestant, Catholic, &amp; Orthodox Views of Vice</p>
<p>Submission Instructions<br/>Submissions should be between 4,000–6,500 words (not including abstract), conform to the Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition), and be original, unpublished works prepared for double- blind peer review. Please include an abstract of no more than 250 words, uploading the entire manuscript in both PDF and .docx formats at www.theophron.org/submissions. Do not place your name or any identifying information on the submitted manuscript—author identities will remain anonymous to reviewers and editors until after final acceptance/rejection decisions.</p>
<p>Extended: Submissions received by February 26, 2023, will be considered for publication. Direct all questions to submissions@theophron.org.<br/>Visit theophron.org for all live calls for papers, including our year-round, open-topic call.</p>

</p><p align="center"><strong>Pliny the Elder: Medicine, Magic, and Religion</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In 2023 the world will celebrate the bimillenary of the birth of Pliny the Elder, who is a widely known author but not studied as much as he deserves. Despite the general interest shown in Pliny and his <em>Natural History</em>, there is still much to explore in his work. Examples of important titles of Plinian scholarship include the monograph of Beagon (1992) and her commentary on Book 7 of the <em>Natural History </em>(2005); Doody’s monograph on the reception of Pliny’s <em>Natural History </em>(2010); the edited volume of Gibson and Morello (2011); and the edited volume of Traina and Vial-Logeay (2022).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to foster further investigation of Pliny and explore themes and issues that have not yet been fully investigated, the Centre for Classical Studies of the School of Arts and Humanities of the University of Lisbon, in collaboration with the Sapienza Università di Roma, is organising two international conferences on the theme ‘Pliny the Elder: Medicine, Magic, and Religion’ to be held during the autumn of 2023.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main goal of these conferences is to study the books of Pliny’s <em>Naturalis Historia </em>that have particular significance in three areas that frequently intersect: medicine, magic, and religion. Researchers and scholars of Pliny and of these areas are invited to submit abstracts for papers to be delivered at these conferences. Speakers are encouraged to employ philological, historical, historico-religious, and anthropological approaches in their presentations, which may investigate any of the following (or other) topics:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pliny and medicine</p>
<ul>
<li>Pliny’s sources;</li>
<li>medical areas are covered;</li>
<li>the reception of Pliny in ancient, medieval and Renaissance medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p> Pliny and magic
</p><ul>
<li>views of Pliny on magic;</li>
<li>practices;</li>
<li>(possible) relation to medicine and/or religion. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Pliny and religion</p>
<ul>
<li><em>superstitio </em>and <em>prodigia</em>;</li>
<li>Pliny and ancient religion;</li>
<li>deities, rituals and religious practices.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Proposals for a 20-minute presentation should be sent to <a href="mailto:pliniusbimillenary@gmail.com">pliniusbimillenary@gmail.com</a> by 31 March 2023. Abstracts should have a maximum of 300 words and include a short biographical note with academic affiliation(s) and main publications (100 words).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Provisional places and dates for these conferences are Lisbon (19-20 October 2023) and Rome (9-10 November 2023). The organisers plan to host the presentation of papers on medicine in Lisbon and papers on magic and religion in Rome. These places and dates will be confirmed so that participants can make appropriate travel plans well in advance of the conferences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The working languages for these conferences will be English and Italian.</p>

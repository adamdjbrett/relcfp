						<description>Venue: Joštova 10<br/><br/><p><strong>“Like a Face Drawn in Sand at the Edge of the Sea.” Vicissitudes of the Posthuman Forty Years After Foucault’s Death.</strong><em> </em></p>
<p>KEYWORDS: <strong>Foucault</strong>, <strong>archeology</strong>, <strong>posthumanism</strong>, <strong>human-machine interaction, more-than-human</strong>. </p>
<p>The <em>Order of Things</em> wished to show the emergence and disappearance of the configurations of knowledge in their empirical arising. Among them, we see man taking his ambivalent place as both mysterious object and sovereign subject of western knowledge, only to soon disappear along the lines of the image we captured in the title. But, however deferred, historiographical and epistemological problems return incessantly, questioning the status of discontinuities in the archaeological project: what backdrop would be able to account for both the emerging and the fading away of orders of identities and differences? To what logic do their mutations respond? What explanation is offered?</p>
<p>According to the archaeological instance, posthuman is then manifestly not a condition of existence but an open process: the uncertain outcome of the mutations of these conditions of possibility, of their precipitation.</p>
<p>What does it mean to question this diagnostic today? What mutations have taken place or struggle to do so? What are the stakes? Would it be legitimate to say that today we speak from the space of knowledge left vacant by the disappearance of the figure of western knowledge that gave rise to the humanities?</p>
<p>The workshop's aim would be to draw a map, though bound to be partial, fragmentary and mobile, of a range of practices both in research and in applied fields related to the tools forged in the debate pertaining to posthumanism. This could be done, on the one hand, by exploring the current functioning of the toolbox elaborated by the thinker in the 1960s and early 1970s, and on the other hand, by interrogating the way in which these tools have been brought into contact and fruitful interaction with different theoretical inputs and epistemic and political instances (feminist, anti-racist, queer, post-colonial, ecological, a.o.).</p></description>

<p>WORKSHOP:  </p>
<p><strong>“Like a Face Drawn in Sand at the Edge of the Sea.” Vicissitudes of the Posthuman Forty Years After Foucault’s Death.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Does man really exist? To imagine, for an instant, what the world and thought and truth might be if man did not exist, is considered to be merely indulging in paradox. This is because we are so blinded by the recent manifestation of man that we can no longer remember a time – and it is not so long ago – when the world, its order, and human beings existed, but man did not.          </p>
<p>M. Foucault, <em>The Order of Things</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Forty years after Foucault's death and sixty after the publication of <em>An Archaeology of the Human Sciences</em>, we would like to invite you to interrogate the posthuman as an open problem and process on the historical and epistemic level. In particular, we would like to discuss whether and how historiographical and methodological issues pertaining to the archeological project have been transformed, scaled down, transposed or partially resolved today.</p>
<p>The <em>Order of Things</em> wished to show the emergence and disappearance of the configurations of knowledge in their empirical arising. Among them, we see man taking his ambivalent place as both mysterious object and sovereign subject of western knowledge, only to soon disappear along the lines of the image we captured in the title. But, however deferred, historiographical and epistemological problems return incessantly, questioning the status of discontinuities in the archaeological project: what backdrop would be able to account for both the emerging and the fading away of orders of identities and differences?

<p>The conference will bring together researchers from the fields of engineering, philosophy, and neighboring disciplines such as technology assessment to address the theme of Understanding, Assessing, and Designing Responsible Futures. fPET 2024 will provide an opportunity to meet like-minded researchers, and to present and discuss issues on the intersection of engineering and philosophy.</p>
<p>The mission of fPET is to encourage reflection on engineering, engineers, and technology; and to build bridges between existing organizations of philosophers, engineers and scholars in related fields.</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<p>We invite abstracts for paper presentations, posters, panels, and experimental sessions on the following (broad) topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophy of engineering and technology</li>

						<description>Venue: Universiteto str. 3<br/><br/><p><strong>Topic Description:<br/></strong>Contrary to philosophy’s normal epistemological predilection, both Kant and Levinas argue for “the primacy of practical reason,” for “ethics as first philosophy,” finding morality at the root of all intelligibility.  Yet for Levinas moral imperative arises as responsible response to the other person’s alterity while for Kant it arises as dutiful respect for law in the other and oneself.<br/>Through explication of texts and discussion, this seminar aims to clarify the grounds and some of the moral and political consequences of their agreement and disagreement.</p>
<p><strong>To apply:<br/></strong>Ten scholars of philosophy and/or political philosophy – professors and graduate students – will be accepted to participate in this round-table seminar.<br/>To apply send: (1) A detailed résumé, curriculum vitae, or brief biography with contact information for two professional references; (2) An application essay which should address your interest, both academic and personal, in the subject to be studied; qualifications and experiences that equip you to do the work of the seminar and to make a contribution to a learning community.</p>
<p>Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis from the present time until deadline, until all ten places are filled. A limited number of auditors will also be accepted. Please indicate if you are applying as an auditor.</p>

Lewis</em></strong><strong>, Call for Chapters</strong></p>
<p>An edited collection tentatively titled “Going to the Movies with C.S. Lewis” is seeking chapter submissions. The book is expected to be published through Cambridge Scholars Publishing. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Having been born many years after C.S. Lewis died I of course never had the opportunity to watch a movie with the man. However, over the years I feel, as many others probably feel as well, like Lewis accompanies me as I watch movies, read books, attend church services, and make other daily pursuits. Lewis’ works shape my thinking on many theological, educational, and cultural matters like few other authors’ works do.</p>
<p>This book is an attempt to take some of those insights from C.S. Lewis and apply them to film studies. It will explore the thought and theology of C.S. Lewis by connecting his work with film theory, specific films, and adaptations of his work. In many ways it is a book meant to explore how Lewis’ thought can help us view films.</p>
<p>The following categories are meant to act as general guidance for sections of the book:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploring Film Theory with C.S. Lewis</li>
<li>Exploring Individual Films with C.S. Lewis</li>
<li>Analyzing Lewis’ Life through Films of About Lewis</li>
<li>Analyzing Lewis’ Fiction through Adaptations of his works</li>
</ol>
<p>Some chapter ideas that would fit into the above categories include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Four Loves on film</li>
<li>Lewis’ approach to literature as a guide to approaching film</li>
<li>“On the Reading of Old Books” and On the Watching of Old Movies</li>
<li>Lewis’ idea of fantasy in relation to particular films</li>
<li>Ideas in his essays or books that relate to film studies, film theory, or individual films</li>
<li>The many different Narnia adaptations (comparisons between the versions or examinations of particular films as adaptations of the original stories)</li>
<li>Lewis’ thoughts on Christmas and Christmas movies (what would Lewis think of Hallmark Christmas movies?)</li>
<li>Lewis portrayed on film – how does this change the way he is viewed?</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, these are only suggestions. Anything connecting Lewis’ thought with the cinema will be considered.  </p>
<p><strong>Submission Procedure</strong></p>
<p>Please submit a chapter proposal by March 31, 2024 which includes the following: title, abstract, and a short biography of the author(s). Proposals should be a maximum of 500 words written in English, using Microsoft Word format, Times New Roman, 12 pt. font. Please send the Word document as an attachment to the book editor (Bryan Mead, <a href="mailto:bmead@etbu.edu">bmead@etbu.edu</a>). Authors of accepted proposals will be notified and sent specific submission guidelines. Chapter contributions should be at least 4,000 words and will follow Chicago style (footnotes and bibliography). Submissions are welcome from early career researchers and established scholars.</p>
<p>If your proposal is accepted, chapter submissions will be due by September 15, 2024. Proposal acceptance does not guarantee chapter’s inclusion in the book.</p>

			<title>[ March 1, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Music and Ethics</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120110</link>
						<description><p>Music and ethics each draw on capacities (e.g., intentionality, empathy, agency) which are older and deeper than the theoretical frameworks which account for them, older even than language itself.</p>
<p>Can parallels be drawn between music and ethics? Do music and ethics have a common root? Or are they atleast intertwined in some way?</p>
<p>This workshop aims to draw connections between music and ethics, especially in terms of pre- linguistic cognition. Topics which might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The experience of temporality and rhythm</li>
<li>Bodily aspects of music and of social interaction generally, including gesture</li>
<li>Music and ethics as structuring interpersonal relationships</li>
<li>The role of rehearsal in gaining musical and ethical capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Interdisciplinary contributions are welcome, including perspectives from philosophy, cognitive science, musicology, psychology, anthropology, archaeology, neurology, and other related fields.</p>
<p>We invite submissions of abstracts on topics related to music and ethics. Abstracts must be anonymizedand no longer than 300 words.</p>
<p>The deadline for submissions is March 1, 2024. Please send yourabstract to music- ethics@gatech.edu. In the body of the message indicate your name and institutional affiliation.</p>
<p>We encourage submissions from graduate students and early career researchers, and funding may be available to support their participation in the workshop.</p>
<p>Full papers are to be submitted by May 1, 2024, for distribution to workshop participants. During the workshop, presentations should be brief and predicated on the assumption that participants have already read the paper itself. Emphasis should then be on discussion.</p>
<p>The event is organized by Robert Kirkman (School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology) and Rachel Elliott (Department of Philosophy, CUNY - College of Staten Island). Please contact the organizers if you require further information.</p></description>

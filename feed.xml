			<title>Shifting Perspectives on Muslimness and Islam in Contemporary Fiction - Special Session - PAMLA 2023 (Oct 26-29, 2023, Portland, OR)</title>

Global, transnational, and comparative perspectives are welcome.</p><p>Description:</p><p>This panel seeks to contextualize the current position of Muslims in Western societies as either marginalized or made hypervisible. More often than not, portrayals of Muslims in the media or popular culture focus on the adherents of the imagined category of ‘Islam,’ rendering the people behind this category invisible. In light of the all-to-common binary distinctions (secular/religious, moderns/traditional, etc.), this panel seeks to contemplate ways toward “a religious literacy that does not overdetermine the role of religion” (Rashid 61). Instead of the either/or trap, an epistemological approach allowing us to trace ‘both/and’ is sought out “since the most common Muslim life is lived amidst a congeries of various laws and norms” (Reinhart 8). The panel seeks to create a space for dialogue about how contemporary literature negotiates holistic but also nuanced identities and how Muslimness is depicted as part of the spectrum of the human experience. Moreover, the panel invites papers investigating the role of literature in shaping the perception and representation of religion and how literature thus contributes to shifting perspectives on Islam and Muslimness.</p><p>You will be able to submit abstract proposals using the online submission form (you will have to go to <a href="https://pamla.ballastacademic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://pamla.ballastacademic.com</a> to login or create an account first). <strong>The deadline to submit presentation proposals is May 31, 2023. </strong>If you have any questions, please contact the panel chair (Maria Mothes) at <a href="mailto:mmothes@uni-koblenz.de">mmothes@uni-koblenz.de</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>PAMLA</p><p>Special Session Chair: Maria Mothes, University of Koblenz, Germany</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:mmothes@uni-koblenz.de">mmothes@uni-koblenz.de</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://pamla.ballastacademic.com/Home/S/18844" target="_blank">https://pamla.ballastacademic.com/Home/S/18844</a></div></div></div></description>

			<title>Special Issue of Religions: Whither Spirituality?</title>

			<description><div><div>Type: </div><div><div>Call for Publications</div></div></div><div><div>Date: </div><div><div><span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2023-08-01T00:00:00-04:00">August 1, 2023</span></div></div></div><div><div>Subject Fields: </div><div><div>Cultural History / Studies, Humanities, Intellectual History, Philosophy, Religious Studies and Theology</div></div></div><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>In the 21st century, amidst a global world still emerging from a shared pandemic, continually contending with increased reliance on technology, and persistently responding to a series of human-made catastrophes, what is meant by spirituality?</p><p>For many, spirituality remains a word wed contingently to religion, often emerging to describe experiential aspects of faith, belief, and practice within an established system of religion. In this usage, spirituality often connects to one’s relationship to the sacred, whether this be a transcendent truth or something more immanent, such as nature.</p><p>However, for a growing chorus of voices, spirituality increasingly speaks to secular realities—it is more and more a placeholder to describe the ongoing pursuit of meaning, the longing for purpose, and the hope for belongingness both within and beyond religious membership. Once the domain of religion, spirituality now emerges in relation to concerns regarding individual wellness and collective well-being, and in connection to areas ranging from medical care, professional development, and leadership skills to various cultural expressions, including the arts, sport, and technology. For individuals who now prefer the moniker spiritual but not religious, spirituality might signify an enduring commitment to belief but without the “baggage” of religious affiliation; for others, spirituality denotes a specifically secular ideal, one that demonstrates how humans continue to seek answers to the major challenges of life without the guiding hand of religious doctrine or authority.</p><p>This Special Issue of <em>Religions</em> seeks contributions that add to, challenge, and seek to complicate the ways in which spirituality emerges, is described, and is applied across both religious and secular landscapes. Is spirituality the experiential or cultural manifestation of religion? What are the results, implications, losses, and values of separating spirituality from religion? What becomes of spirituality within secularity? How do Western notions of spirituality impact global cultural knowledge? What occurs when spirituality and spiritual practices are appropriated in the name of wellness? How do digital spaces connect to spiritual practices and understandings? And what might all this tell us about both spirituality and the continued place of religion in our contemporary moment?</p><p>Potential topics include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Spirituality and Religion</li><li>Spirituality or Religion</li><li>Global Spirituality</li><li>Spirituality or Spiritualities?</li><li>Spiritual vs. Spirituality</li><li>Spirituality and Nature</li><li>Spirituality and Environmentalism</li><li>Spirituality and Justice</li><li>Spirituality and Culture</li><li>Spirituality and Digital Culture</li><li>Spirituality and Technology</li><li>Spiritual But Not Religious</li><li>The Nones</li><li>Spirituality and Wellness</li><li>Secular Spirituality</li><li>Problems/Limits of Definition(s)</li><li>Religion, Spirituality, Theology, and Processes of Classification</li><li>Spirituality and Philosophy</li><li>Spirituality and Public Life</li><li>Spirituality, Politics, and Economics</li><li>Spirituality and Appropriation</li><li>Spiritual Tourism</li><li>Spirituality and the New Age</li><li>Indigeneity and Spirituality</li></ul><p>Dr. Morgan Shipley<br/><em>Guest Editor</em></p><p><strong>Manuscript Submission Information</strong></p><p>Manuscripts should be submitted online at <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/" rel="nofollow">www.mdpi.com</a> by <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/user/register/" rel="nofollow">registering</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/user/login/" rel="nofollow">logging in to this website</a>.

<p><strong>Esotericism, Occultism, and Magic</strong> invites proposals relating to magical worldviews, practices, and representations, as well as consciousness transformation, hidden meanings, the power of transmutation, and related phenomena. Characteristic beliefs and practices include: arcane symbolism, imagery, and aesthetics; unseen forces and spiritual intermediaries; synchronous patterns, non-ordinary causation, and anomalous processes. Examples of ideas and systems include Theosophy, Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Hermeticism, Gnosticism, Sufism, Satanism, Tantra, witchcraft, sorcery, demonology, astrology, alchemy, shamanism, yoga, parapsychology, and psychic and paranormal phenomena, along with beliefs and practices relating to altered states of consciousness, overlapping with the study of mysticism as well as New Age spirituality, channeling, positive thinking, manifest intention, guardian angels, and Ascended Masters. Esoteric, occult, and magical concepts, beliefs, and practices appear in every culture and civilization; contemporary media and popular culture have embraced them enthusiastically, yet at times have reacted against them. The impact of esotericism, occultism, and magic on genre formation/content and popular cultural perceptions has been profound.</p>
<p>Special themes for the Summer Salon may include the following, but all proposals suitable to the Area will be considered: the construction and representation of EOM traditions and traditionalisms; the role of narratives and counter-narratives in the formation of EOM worldviews; metafiction and metatextuality; symbolic representations of conspiracy; misidentification, confusion, and conflation of identity among and between EOM systems and traditions, both emically and etically; EOM and transgression; EOM as a vector of conflicts concerning identity, ethnicity, race, class, gender, sexuality, and sociocultural tensions; EOM and the counterculture; EOM and New Age thought; cryptohistory; intersections of EOM systems and traditions with demonization and/or diabolization; historical interactions and mutual influences between EOM worldviews and/or practitioners and the realms of cryptography and espionage; EOM and the monstrous, inhuman, unhuman, abhuman, transhuman, and post-human; EOM and augmented reality, virtual reality, metacognition, metanarrative, artifice, and the uncanny (valley); conception, creation, conjuration, and animation of artificial life, unlife, the undead, spirits, servitors, familiars, elementals, homunculi, and constructs; EOM and the paranormal; EOM representations in alternative media; the mainstreaming of EOM; the intersection of EOM with popular spirituality, including popular numerology and astrology, angel beliefs, self-help, popular witchcraft and spellcasting; EOM across, within, between, and <em>as </em>genre; archives, archaicism, and nostalgia; canonicity in representations and transmissions; fantasy and escapism in worldview, practice, and representation; scrying, divination, surveillance, the “seer” and conceptions/representations of the “watchers”; eroticism, love, romance, and romanticism; EOM and aesthetics; EOM as transdisciplinary</p>

			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110425</link>
						<description>Venue: 170 St George St<br/><br/><p>Emmanuel Renault (Université Paris Nanterre) will join Dramaturgies of Resistance for a lecture and workshop on Friday, April 21. In these two events, Renault will address the return of labour within critical theory and the experience of exploitation in theories of domination.</p>

<p>The <em>afternoon workshop</em> will take up Renault’s manuscript <em>Exploités</em> and include responses by Nicole Yokum (University of Toronto, St. George), Natasha Hay (University of Toronto, Scarborough), and Matthew Delhey (University of Toronto, St. George).</p>
<p>Those interested in participating in the workshop should email Matthew Delhey (matt.delhey@mail.utoronto.ca) to obtain the reading materials.</p>
<p>Schedule:</p>
<p>Lecture:               10:00 — 12:00 p.m. ("Abolishing division of labour or making it better?")</p>
<p>Lunch break:      12:00 — 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Workshop on "The Experience of Exploitation" (Part Three of <em>Exploités</em>)</p>

<p>Session 3:            4:00 — 5:00 p.m. (comments by Matthew Delhey)</p>
<p>Excerpt from <em>Exploités</em>: "The term exploitation is frequently employed in everyday language, and it is the object of a renewed interest in various contemporary political projects, yet it remains largely discredited in the academic fields of social philosophy, political theory and critical social sciences. If exploitation is frequently considered to be uninteresting in these fields, it is more often due to prejudice rather than because it is not a concept that merits serious discussion. Academic disinterest in exploitation is therefore intellectually and politically problematic. We have already suggested that exploitation lies at the heart of a revival that is politically significant. This sets a mandate for social philosophy, political theory, and critical social science to think about exploitation in a new way. Hence the twofold objective of this book: to dismantle the foundations of the academic consensus that sees the concept of exploitation as theoretically less interesting than other critical concepts or even as a politically useless or dangerous concept; to rethink the meaning and functions of the concept of exploitation in accordance with contemporary renewals of the critique of exploitation the theorisations to which they give rise."</p>
<p>Emmanuel Renault is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris Nanterre. He is the author of numerous publications on Hegel, Marx, and pragmatism within the tradition of critical theory. His books in English include <em>The Experience of Injustice: A Theory of Recognition</em> (Columbia University Press, 2019), <em>Marx and Critical Theory</em> (Brill, 2018), and <em>The Return of Work in Critical Theory: Self, Society, Politics</em> (Columbia University Press, 2018).</p>
<p>Date and time: Friday, April 21, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>

			<title>[ May 19, 2023] Talk or similar: The Idea of a New Man between Religion and Enlightenment: The Evolution of the concept from Luther to Kant</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110413</link>
						<description>Venue: Krakowskie Przedmieście 3 <br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Anna Szyrwińska-Hörig (Universität Vechta)<br/><br/><p><strong>Abstract<br/><br/></strong></p>
<p>In The Conflict of the Faculties Immanuel Kant discussed the paradigmatic concept of a “new man” asking how people could become morally “not merely better human beings but other human beings”. Such idea of enhancement of human nature is standardly acknowledged as one of the most representative postulates of the Enlightenment epoch. However, the concept of a new man was initially not an Enlightenment accomplishment, since its roots go back to the biblical doctrine of spiritual renewal. The idea of regeneration (New Birth, Wiedergeburt, Restoratio, etc.) was strongly emphasized in the early modern protestant movements, i.e. Arminianism and Pietism. Thus, one can assume that protestant theology played a crucial role in developing the new man ethos in the Age of Enlightenment.</p>
<p><br/> The purpose of the paper is to present the evolution of the idea of a new man during the time span from the beginning of Reformation to the end of the 18th Century. Particularly it will be explained how the originally theological concept of spiritual restoration (in both Lutheran and Reformed interpretation) was systematically adopted in the philosophic context. Furthermore, it will be shown what consequences did it have for the further development of Enlightenment philosophic anthropology.</p></description>

			<title>[Today] Talk or similar: The Earliest Latin Maimonides, the “Reasons for the Commandments,” and the Perfection of the Soul</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110369</link>
						<description>Venue: 17 Rue de la Sorbonne<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Lucy Pick<br/><br/><p>In her talk, Lucy Pick will present some of her discoveries about the earliest Latin translation of Moses Maimonides’ <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em>, which is found in the <em>Liber de parabolis et mandatis</em>, a text from 1223–24 that prefaces a translation of Book III, 29–49 of the <em>Guide</em> on the reasons for the commandments, with an introductory explanation and demonstration of allegorical exegesis. This demonstration not only instructs its readers in the methods of exegesis, it also develops a picture that seems to derive from Avicenna of the human soul, riven by conflicting influences but capable of perfection. She will discuss this introduction and ask why this fascinating text, which she attributes to the joint work of Samuel ibn Tibbon (translator of the <em>Guide</em> from Arabic to Hebrew) and Michael Scot (known for his translations from Arabic into Latin), pairs such an argument with Maimonides’ discussion of the rational and historical reasons for the commandments.</p></description>

			<title>[ May 11, 2023] Talk or similar: Hume on Hypotheses and Enlightenment Epistemology of Religion</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110377</link>
						<description>Venue: Grodzka 52<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Gianenrico Paganini<br/><br/><p><strong>Abstract<br/><br/></strong>The experimental theist Cleanthes and the skeptical Philo in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Epicurus in the oration of the First Enquiry, deal all with the same problem and endorse the same epistemology. Both the method and the argument come from Newton’s Principia: the former derives from the famous regulae philosophandi and the argument from the Scholium generale appended to the third book of the Principia. Not only the theologians of the Boyle lectures, but Newton himself, in the Scholium generale, had established a close connection between the use of induction, the rejection of hypotheses, the argument from of design or final causes, and the conception of a "living, intelligent, powerful being”, that governs the world as a Lord. It is notable that Newton did not hesitate to include God among the objects of “natural philosophy”. The Dialogues represent a challenge to this “experimental theism” inspired by Newton, but also they aim at rehabilitating the function of hypotheses, against Newton’s famous veto, albeit in a new form that is compatible with the scepticism endorsed by the protagonist of the work, Philo. This new reading of the Dialogues centred on Philo’s “hypotheticism” also sheds more light on the meaning and scope of the work.</p></description>

The Greek Patriarch of Constantinople – Saint Hieromartyr, as of January 2022 – owes most of his enduring fame to a “Calvinist” Confession of Faith that was published in Geneva, first in Latin, in 1629, then in Greek, with additions, in 1633. Translated into French, English, German, and Italian, and re-edited several times, this laconic text triggered passionate debates across Europe, forcing Eastern Christianity to address theological issues never tackled before. Yet there is much more to Loukaris than his Confession of Faith, as the first ORTHPOL Conference will show.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Taking recent scholarship on Loukaris as starting point and favouring a source-oriented approach, the project members and their guests will discuss the catalytic role played by the controversial Patriarch in the making of Eastern Orthodoxy.

Nichols</a> (University of California, Santa Barbara)</span></p><hr/><h3>ABOUT</h3><p>The detrimental effects of carbon-based fuel sources, including and especially their contribution to anthropogenic climate change, has motivated scientists to develop alternative renewable energy solutions. Among those, nuclear power has been the most highly contested because of the associated risks to the health and stability of ecological systems. Many scientists argue that a carbon-neutral energy future is not feasible without the continued development of nuclear power technologies.</p><p>Anti-nuclear activists, however, have long argued that the potential associated dangers to the health and stability of ecological systems make nuclear power an unnecessarily risky response to the global energy crisis. They have expressed concerns, e.g., about the elevated risks of nuclear contamination incidents as global sea levels rise and threaten a majority of the world’s extant nuclear facilities and interim storage sites. Moreover, activists are increasingly concerned about social and environmental justice issues and the transgenerational effects of nuclear waste spills and radiation incidents on both human and ecosystem health and viability. </p><p>The nuclear debate raises many complicated questions at the intersection of ethics and technological innovation of our time, including ‘What are the long-term social and environmental justice implications of nuclear technologies when we consider the effects on both human and non-human species?’.</p><hr/><h3>THEMES</h3><p>The conference theme, “Global Legacies of Anti-Nuclear Activism: Intersectional Perspectives”  is a direct invitation to those scholars working on the following:</p><ul><li><p>Historical approaches that shed light on specific movements, individuals, groups, actions, or research/discoveries that have made significant contributions to the anti-nuclear movement, especially those from minority perspectives and/or those with transnational or gender implications, and the reactions they triggered in society, domestic and international politics, and regulatory changes; </p></li><li><p>Contemporary approaches (impacted by specific politics of memory) that shape current understandings and discourses about nuclear technologies and their critics;</p></li><li><p>Illuminating and minimizing disparity, inequality, and inequity in the research, development, and utilization of nuclear technologies; </p></li><li><p>Inquiries into the intersection of religion, gender, sexuality, and embodiment with the construction of scientific and technological forms of knowledge and the rhetoric of nuclear technologies;</p></li><li><p>Ethical critiques and compatibility of nuclear technologies (including nuclear weapons, power, waste, and storage) with environmental and social justice, indigenous rights perspectives, and religious/ethical or secular/scientific perspectives; </p></li><li><p>Public education and empowerment of individuals and communities with the tools and resources (e.g., political, social, environmental, economic, etc.) necessary for protecting themselves and their environments; </p></li><li><p>Approaches that consider the effects of nuclear technologies on non-human species and ecological and planetary systems; </p></li><li><p>Intersections with capitalism, extractivism, disposability, necropolitics, and ‘throw-away culture’; </p></li><li><p>Emerging nuclear technologies and approaches focused on creating resilient energy futures based on recent climate science data and public resistance; </p></li><li><p>Identifying and understanding the intersectional effects and social and environmental justice concerns of global energy transitions;</p></li><li><p>Engagement of nuclear technologies and post-truth technologies (social media, misinformation, science denial, conspiracy); </p></li><li><p>Artistic expressions and other forms of cultural manifestations of the (anti-) nuclear discourse, i.e., future visions and worldmaking, nuclear technologies in science fiction, dystopia, utopia, apocalypticism, Afro-futurism, Afro-pessimism, and promised, unrealized, and emerging human and non-human futures;</p></li><li><p>Nuclear technologies and planetary boundaries, especially as they intersect with matters of race, gender, and social and environmental justice.</p></li></ul><p>We also invite other proposals that fit broadly within the conference theme.</p><hr/><h3>PROPOSALS</h3><p>We welcome proposals from scholars working on intersectional approaches to global anti-nuclear activism in historical and contemporary perspective across the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences for a multi-day conference and writer’s workshop which will be held at the University of California, Santa Barbara in April 2024. </p><p>Selected participants will submit papers that will be pre-circulated among participants of a workshop in Santa Barbara, where they will engage with fellow participants and invited guest speakers and workshop their contributions for a peer-reviewed edited volume published with a university press.</p><hr/><h3><strong>TO APPLY</strong></h3><p>Please submit a 150-word abstract and a 500-1,000 word proposal via our conference website <a href="http://www.antinuclearactivism.org/" rel="nofollow">www.antinuclearactivism.org</a> <strong>by June 15, 2023</strong>.  </p><p>Decisions will be communicated to all applicants by <strong>August 31, 2023</strong>.</p><p>If you have further questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:mail@antinuclearactivism.org">mail@antinuclearactivism.org</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><u><strong>Conveners:</strong></u></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.maklimke.com/" rel="nofollow">Martin Klimke</a> (New York University Abu Dhabi)</li><li><a href="https://es.ucsb.edu/people/amanda-m-nichols" rel="nofollow">Amanda M.

<p> </p>
<p>Established in 1968 as a direct result of Black student struggle on campus, the Black Studies Department—now Africana Studies Department— at San Francisco State University was the first Black Studies department in the nation. The establishment of the department also marked the institutionalization Black Studies “as a ‘scientific discipline’ rooted in racial redemption, liberatory scholarship and community revitalization, the discipline of Africana Studies is a body of systematized knowledge, theories, methods, and laws, which are congruent with the African centered paradigm and philosophy.” (Tshaka, 2012, p 29).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sixty years later, Black Studies—and all its colloquiums such as African American Studies, Africana Studies, Africology, African Diasporic Studies—has seen much growth and evolution in the field. It is in this vein that this work seeks to critically engage subjects relevant to people of African descent in the 21st century, from an African centered perspective.</p>

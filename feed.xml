			<title>[ September 5, 2024 -  September 6, 2024] Conference or similar: The Existential Dimension of Doubt</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120374</link>
						<description>Venue: Avenue Campus<br/><br/><p><strong>‘The Existential Dimension of Doubt’ - Launch Conference of the ERC Advanced grant project ‘The Ethics of Doubt – Kierkegaard, Scepticism and Conspiracy Theory’, September 5-6, 2024, University of Southampton, UK</strong></p>
<p>While the ancient sceptics regarded scepticism about knowledge as a way of life, philosophers from Descartes to the present day have viewed it primarily as an intellectual problem that requires only a theoretical solution. The aim of this conference is to challenge this contention by focussing on the ‘existential’ dimension of doubt – i.e. the way in which sceptical problems affect the whole person. For example, Danish philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard, has proposed that doubt and anxiety are intrinsically linked, and, hence, that doubt may not just be an epistemic vice (if it is one), but also a character failing that consists in a refusal to confront (and to try and overcome) certain forms of <em>angst</em>, such as, for instance, a refusal to face up to the radical contingency and fragility of the (human) world and to take refuge in a ‘scapegoating’ scenario, where super-powerful, hidden agents are to blame: Descartes’ Evil Demon, on the one hand, or, say, a ‘Deep State’ controlling our actions, on the other. The conference aims to explore these issues from a number of different philosophical perspectives (both Kierkegaardian and non-Kierkegaardian) and to bring together Kierkegaard scholars and epistemologists, working in both theoretical and applied areas of the subject.</p>
<p>Confirmed speakers include: Anita Avramides (Oxford), Yuval Avnur (Scripps), Lucy Campbell (Warwick), Annalisa Coliva (UCI), Jim Conant (Chicago),<br/>Rick Furtak (Colorado), Stephen Mulhall (Oxford), Marilyn Piety (Drexel), Duncan Pritchard (UCI), Mark A. Tietjen (Stony Brook).</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending, please contact my post-doc, Dr. Taylor Matthews (T.Matthews@soton.ac.uk).</p></description>

						<description>Venue: Joštova 10<br/><br/><p><strong>“Like a Face Drawn in Sand at the Edge of the Sea.” Vicissitudes of the Posthuman Forty Years After Foucault’s Death.</strong><em> </em></p>
<p>KEYWORDS: <strong>Foucault</strong>, <strong>archeology</strong>, <strong>posthumanism</strong>, <strong>human-machine interaction, more-than-human</strong>. </p>
<p>The <em>Order of Things</em> wished to show the emergence and disappearance of the configurations of knowledge in their empirical arising. Among them, we see man taking his ambivalent place as both mysterious object and sovereign subject of western knowledge, only to soon disappear along the lines of the image we captured in the title. But, however deferred, historiographical and epistemological problems return incessantly, questioning the status of discontinuities in the archaeological project: what backdrop would be able to account for both the emerging and the fading away of orders of identities and differences? To what logic do their mutations respond? What explanation is offered?</p>
<p>According to the archaeological instance, posthuman is then manifestly not a condition of existence but an open process: the uncertain outcome of the mutations of these conditions of possibility, of their precipitation.</p>
<p>What does it mean to question this diagnostic today? What mutations have taken place or struggle to do so? What are the stakes? Would it be legitimate to say that today we speak from the space of knowledge left vacant by the disappearance of the figure of western knowledge that gave rise to the humanities?</p>
<p>The workshop's aim would be to draw a map, though bound to be partial, fragmentary and mobile, of a range of practices both in research and in applied fields related to the tools forged in the debate pertaining to posthumanism. This could be done, on the one hand, by exploring the current functioning of the toolbox elaborated by the thinker in the 1960s and early 1970s, and on the other hand, by interrogating the way in which these tools have been brought into contact and fruitful interaction with different theoretical inputs and epistemic and political instances (feminist, anti-racist, queer, post-colonial, ecological, a.o.).</p></description>

<p>WORKSHOP:  </p>
<p><strong>“Like a Face Drawn in Sand at the Edge of the Sea.” Vicissitudes of the Posthuman Forty Years After Foucault’s Death.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Does man really exist? To imagine, for an instant, what the world and thought and truth might be if man did not exist, is considered to be merely indulging in paradox. This is because we are so blinded by the recent manifestation of man that we can no longer remember a time – and it is not so long ago – when the world, its order, and human beings existed, but man did not.          </p>
<p>M. Foucault, <em>The Order of Things</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Forty years after Foucault's death and sixty after the publication of <em>An Archaeology of the Human Sciences</em>, we would like to invite you to interrogate the posthuman as an open problem and process on the historical and epistemic level. In particular, we would like to discuss whether and how historiographical and methodological issues pertaining to the archeological project have been transformed, scaled down, transposed or partially resolved today.</p>
<p>The <em>Order of Things</em> wished to show the emergence and disappearance of the configurations of knowledge in their empirical arising. Among them, we see man taking his ambivalent place as both mysterious object and sovereign subject of western knowledge, only to soon disappear along the lines of the image we captured in the title. But, however deferred, historiographical and epistemological problems return incessantly, questioning the status of discontinuities in the archaeological project: what backdrop would be able to account for both the emerging and the fading away of orders of identities and differences?

			<title>[ July 15, 2024 -  July 19, 2024] Conference or similar: Imperatives of Alterity and Law in Levinas and Kant</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120190</link>
						<description>Venue: Universiteto str. 3<br/><br/><p><strong>Topic Description:<br/></strong>Contrary to philosophy’s normal epistemological predilection, both Kant and Levinas argue for “the primacy of practical reason,” for “ethics as first philosophy,” finding morality at the root of all intelligibility.  Yet for Levinas moral imperative arises as responsible response to the other person’s alterity while for Kant it arises as dutiful respect for law in the other and oneself.<br/>Through explication of texts and discussion, this seminar aims to clarify the grounds and some of the moral and political consequences of their agreement and disagreement.</p>
<p><strong>To apply:<br/></strong>Ten scholars of philosophy and/or political philosophy – professors and graduate students – will be accepted to participate in this round-table seminar.<br/>To apply send: (1) A detailed résumé, curriculum vitae, or brief biography with contact information for two professional references; (2) An application essay which should address your interest, both academic and personal, in the subject to be studied; qualifications and experiences that equip you to do the work of the seminar and to make a contribution to a learning community.</p>
<p>Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis from the present time until deadline, until all ten places are filled. A limited number of auditors will also be accepted. Please indicate if you are applying as an auditor.</p>
<p>There is no registration fee.  The LPSS provides no financial support.</p></description>

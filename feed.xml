<p data-adtags-visited="true">Edited by Scott Donahue-Martens and Brandon Simonson</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) that was created in 1974 and popularized in the 1970’s and 1980’s, though it has found a renaissance in contemporary popular culture due in part to its prominent role in the Netflix series Stranger Things. The COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in virtual Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) gaming via work-from-home platforms such as Zoom; from their living rooms, people across the world would work in the virtual office by day and venture into the fantasy worlds of D&amp;D by evening. Additionally, the rising popularity of live-streamers and groups with enormous followings, such as Critical Role, underscores the prominent role that the game continues to hold with tabletop gamers and speaks to the diverse manners in which D&amp;D is enjoyed.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">The fantasy worlds of D&amp;D are replete with religious imagery and rely on the theological imagination. Real-world theological and religious concepts and ideas inform this theological imagination, placing human players in foreign yet familiar settings. Guidebooks provide source material for religious and belief structures, as well as deities and player classes that engage both religion and theology. D&amp;D utilizes theology and religion in its expansive mythos, worldbuilding, and everyday experiences of adventures.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">The editors gladly invite submissions on, but not limited to, the topics below for a volume on the intersections of academic disciplines of theology, religious studies, and the creative world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D), to be published in the Theology, Religion, and Popular Culture book series. Interested authors should send chapter abstracts of 300-700 words, along with a CV or resume, to <a href="mailto:theology.religion.dnd@gmail.com">theology.religion.dnd@gmail.com</a>.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: "Doctor Virtualis" no. 19 'Fragments of Order and Disorder in the Middle Ages'<br/><br/><p><strong>Call for paper “Doctor Virtualis” 19</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Fragments of order and disorder in the Middle Ages</em></strong></p>
<p>«Sosteneva, fra l’altro, che le inopinate catastrofi non sono mai la conseguenza o l’effetto che dir si voglia d’un unico motivo, d’una causa al singolare: ma sono come un vortice, un punto di depressione ciclonica nella coscienza del mondo, verso cui hanno cospirato tutta una molteplicità di causali convergenti. Diceva anche nodo o groviglio, o garbuglio, o gnommero, che alla romana vuol dire gomitolo»</p>
<p>(C.E. Gadda, <em>Quer pasticciaccio brutto de via Merulana</em>)</p>
<p>If, as Paul Valéry says in his <em>Introduction to the Method of Leonardo da Vinci</em>, “thinking is only an effort to pass from disorder to order”, it can then be complicated to move from need to knowledge and to be able to grasp, if indeed there is one, the ordered structure of the world.</p>
<p>Starting from the conviction that the requirement for order is peculiar to man, almost like a cognitive and practical need, this issue intends to reflect on the problem of order in a particular historical moment, the Middle Ages. It is a period in which, unlike the Greek world, eternity, which should present itself almost as a paradigm of order, appears cluttered and intricate. “His eternity registers once and for all (<em>uno intelligendi actu</em>) not only every moment of this replete world but also all that would take place if the most evanescent instant were to change – as well as all that are impossible. His precise and combinatory eternity is much more copious than the universe” (J.L. Borges, <em>History of Eternity</em>, p. 134).</p>
<p>The Middle Ages provide an interesting viewpoint from which to observe the problem of order, beginning with its significant declination in the thought of Augustine of Hippo, where it is closely connected to the concept of “relation” that allows one to think about and articulate the complexity of the world. It is not so much the objects that are of interest, but rather their relationships, not least because the very paradigm of the ordered texture of the world, namely the Trinitarian God, is by essence relationship.</p>
<p>“Doctor Virtualis” 19 therefore intends to collect contributions that reflect on the theme of order and disorder and their relationships, seeking to encourage both investigations into medieval thought, as well as research that intends to emphasise the real or merely possible dialogues that the Middle Ages entertains or may entertain with other historical periods.</p>
<p>We propose to articulate the issue in two general section that nevertheless cannot be conceived as radically distinct.</p>
<p>Firstly, the question of order can refer to the “understanding of the world”, i.e. how the phenomena that appear, the cognitive structures that grasp them and their mutual relationship are conceivable. Observing the entanglement of connections that connect natural, human and divine phenomena, and attempting to intervene in the search for a meaning, a criterion, an order to understand the world, represent a first possible line of investigation. Throughout the Middle Ages, various disciplines were established as attempts to respond to the need to understand the world: from theories of knowledge and language, through physics to eschatology.</p>
<p>Secondly, alongside the attempt to understand the world, there emerges the desire to create and organise new ones, which would rationalise and regulate a sometimes shapeless and evolving matter in order to turn it towards higher aims, such as the good and justice. The order-disorder dialectic is therefore also manifested in the proposals that aspire to confer an order, a legality to human actions and associated life. Ethics, politics and law present themselves not only as models for understanding the world, but also as instruments for the constitution of the self and associated living.</p>
<p>Contributions are therefore welcome that reflect on the theme of complexity, of the nexus between order and disorder in the Middle Ages, trying to fit within (though not exclusively) the following thematic lines:</p>
<p><strong>1. Understanding the world </strong></p>
<p>How did the Middle Ages attempt to respond to the need to understand the complexity of the world? What understanding of complexity and relational entanglement?</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Gnoseological theme: disciplines, language, exegesis.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Physical subject matter: metaphysics of the relationship, exegetical symbolism, Platonic and Aristotelian physics; does the Middle Ages question contemporary physics?</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Eschatological theme: salvation history and revealed signs in the Scriptures, in the world, in history; relationship between Old and New Testament; relationship between eschatology and forms of life.</p>
<p><strong>2. Creating and regulating worlds</strong></p>
<p>How did the Middle Ages attempt to intervene not only to understand, but also to regulate passions, actions, behaviour? Did theoretical reflection help to create a new ethical, political, legal 'subject'?</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Ethical theme: the passions of the soul and their classification, moral order and disorder</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Political: order and disorder in the constitution of associated life, political harmony/harmony</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Legal theme: plurality of legal norms (<em>ordo iuris and horror discordantium canonum</em>), expressions of the spirit (movements, doctrines, arts) and law, social behaviour and legal norms</p>
<p><strong>Deadlines</strong></p>

The COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in virtual Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) gaming via work-from-home platforms such as Zoom; from their living rooms, people across the world would work in the virtual office by day and venture into the fantasy worlds of D&amp;D by evening. Additionally, the rising popularity of live-streamers and groups with enormous followings, such as Critical Role, underscores the prominent role that the game continues to hold with tabletop gamers and speaks to the diverse manners in which D&amp;D is enjoyed.</p><p>The fantasy worlds of D&amp;D are replete with religious imagery and rely on the theological imagination. Real-world theological and religious concepts and ideas inform this theological imagination, placing human players in foreign yet familiar settings. Guidebooks provide source material for religious and belief structures, as well as deities and player classes that engage both religion and theology. D&amp;D utilizes theology and religion in its expansive mythos, worldbuilding, and everyday experiences of adventures.</p><p>The editors gladly invite submissions on, but not limited to, the topics below for a volume on the intersections of academic disciplines of theology, religious studies, and the creative world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D), to be published in the Theology, Religion, and Popular Culture book series. Interested authors should send chapter abstracts of 300-700 words, along with a CV or resume, to <a href="mailto:theology.religion.dnd@gmail.com">theology.religion.dnd@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>Methodologies and Approaches: theological, religious, or other disciplines intersecting with some aspect or concepts from the D&amp;D universe. Topics might include:</p><ul><li>The relationship between theology and role-play for spiritual formation.</li><li>Pastoral theology: D&amp;D and spiritual care.</li><li>The three-tiered universe, the sacred canopy, and postmodern epistemology.</li><li>Gaming or games as spiritual or religious practice.</li><li>The collaborative roles of the Dungeon Master and players, the roles of clergy and laity.</li><li>The place of ritual and spellcasting, the place of liturgy and sacrament.</li><li>Diverse theological systems, henotheism, polytheism, etc. and D&amp;D pantheons.</li><li>Mythology and formation: understanding the structuring role of narrative.</li><li>Existentialism, adventuring, and the quest for meaningful living.</li></ul><p>Themes: theological and/or religious explorations of major themes related to the D&amp;D universe. Topics might include:</p><ul><li>Mainstream acceptance, how popular culture contributed to shifting public perceptions of D&amp;D.</li><li>Race (now changed to species), class, gender, and other revisions in the D&amp;D universe.</li><li>The commodification of hobbies, capitalism and D&amp;D.</li><li>Fantasy/Tolkien’s influence on D&amp;D.</li><li>Can good people play evil characters?</li><li>Theological or religious tolerance and pluralism amid competing complex belief structures.</li><li>The lingering impact of past-trauma in characters’ backstories and the enactment of woundedness. The death of an imagined character and loss.</li><li>Interaction between human and non-human (“others”). </li><li>Non-combative conflict transformation.</li><li>Are the dice gods mad at me, determinism and free-will?</li><li>Good versus evil, are devils beyond redemption?</li><li>Friendship, companionship, and mental health.</li><li>Vocation/Calling and teamwork: multiclassing outside of traditional boxes.</li></ul><p>Works: Topics might include:</p><ul><li><em>Stranger Things </em>and Christian fear of D&amp;D.</li><li>An analysis of part of some aspect of a prominent campaign or popular culture portrayal of D&amp;D (like Critical Role, the “C” Team, or <em>Onward</em>).</li><li>Media portrayal of D&amp;D, or stereotypes of table-top gamers and bullying, exclusion, or escapism.</li><li>An analysis of a major D&amp;D campaign like<em> Tomb of Annihilation</em>, <em>Lost Mine of Phandelver, Storm King’s Thunder</em>, etc.</li><li>Engagement with the fantasy books set in the D&amp;D universe like <em>The Legend of Drizzt</em>.</li><li>Baldur’s Gate: online RPG in the D&amp;D universe</li></ul><p>The call for chapters ends February 15, 2023. Authors will be notified of accepted proposals on March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2023. Authors will submit their accepted chapters by August 31<sup>st</sup>, 2023. Final chapters with revisions will be due March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2024 with an anticipated publication date honoring the upcoming 50<sup>th</sup>anniversary of D&amp;D.</p><p>The editors ask that all contributors engage with the existing academic literature on D&amp;D. While the editors will not prescribe particular sources or methodologies, proposals should reflect acquaintance with current scholarship on D&amp;D and final drafts are expected to engage with this scholarship. In other words, we expect each chapter to critically engage D&amp;D along with other scholars.</p><p>Scott Donahue-Martens is a Ph.D. candidate at Boston University School of Theology. He studies the narrative phenomenology of Paul Ricoeur, especially as it relates to homiletics and hermeneutics. He holds a Master of Sacred Theology from Boston University School of Theology and a Master of Divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary.</p><p>Brandon Simonson holds a Ph.D. in Religious Studies from Boston University. Dr. Simonson is currently an Instructor of Biblical Studies at Boston University School of Theology and an adjunct lecturer in the Department of Religious and Theological Studies at Merrimack College.

			<title>[ April 30, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Us and Them: Phenomenological Perspectives in Dialogue</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107049</link>
						<description><p><strong>Call for Abstracts</strong></p>
<p>In classical phenomenology we find reflections on collective intentionality, community, <em>Mitsein</em>, fellow-feeling, interaction, and empathy, which have in turn motivated recent dialogue between phenomenology and the social and cognitive sciences. What has often remained in the background, however, is the question of how to conceive of the relationship between 'Us' and 'Them'. This draws attention to issues of exclusion, marginalisation, national identity, social identities, (non-)belonging, and conflict. In this conference we thus want to explore the various ways in which 'Us' and 'Them' are related, interdependent, and stand in opposition to one another. Our aim is to not only reflect on and better understand the Us/Them dichotomy, but also to put pressure on its assumed dichotomous nature.</p>
<p> Central questions that will be addressed include: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the relation of the "Us" to the "Them"? Is it for example one of conjunction, antagonism, or negation?</li>
<li>What material, normative, affective, or epistemic common ground is taken-for-granted in the assertion of an "Us"?</li>
<li>What are the limitations of distinguishing between inter- and intra-group distinctions? How might phenomenology expand on or show the limits of social scientific research and vice versa?</li>
<li>What role does communication play in mitigating or overcoming the Us/Them dichotomy?</li>
<li>In what ways are different institutions oriented around an implicitly demarcated sense of "Us"? How are similarities and differences rhetorically and discursively exaggerated for political and economic purposes?</li>
</ul>
<p>We particularly encourage papers that bring classical, critical, and applied phenomenological approaches into dialogue with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political philosophy</li>
<li>Critical theory</li>
<li>Feminist philosophy</li>
<li>Social psychology</li>
<li>Social identity theory</li>
<li>Discourse analysis</li>
<li>Political science</li>
<li>Queer theory</li>
<li>Gender studies</li>
<li>Trans* studies and trans* philosophy</li>
<li>Postcolonial and decolonial studies</li>
<li>Sociology</li>
<li>Anthropology</li>
<li>Social ontology</li>
<li>Critical race studies</li>
<li>Migration studies</li>
<li>Affective sciences</li>
<li>Disability studies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>All speakers will be expected to present in-person. Audience participation will be facilitated via Zoom. Speakers will be given 20 minutes to present their paper, along with 10 minutes for Q&amp;A. Papers are expected to address any topic under the heading of 'Us and Them' broadly construed.</p>
<p>We are hoping this event, alongside a conference organized on <em>Critical Phenomenology of the We, </em>will lead to a special issue involving some of the keynote speakers from either conference. Any paper presented at the <em>Us and Them</em> conference will also be encouraged to submit their full papers for consideration.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Submission Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>We invite submissions of titles and abstracts (<strong>300-500 words</strong>) for individual papers. Please prepare abstracts for anonymous review in word or PDF form.</p>
<p>Submissions should be sent to Julia Zaenker <strong>juz@hum.ku.dk</strong>. Please use the following title in the subject line of your email: “Proposal – Us and Them conference". Personal information (author name and affiliation) should be included in the body of the email.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Dates</strong></p>
<p>Latest date to submit titles and abstracts to Julia Zaenker <strong>juz@hum.ku.dk</strong> (300-500 words): <strong>30 April 2023</strong></p>
<p>Notification of reviewers' decision: <strong>31 May 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Date and location</strong></p>
<p>5-6 October 2023, University of Copenhagen, South Campus</p>

Holy texts provide support for both war and peace. In recent decades especially, religion has been viewed as contributing to global strife. The war between Russia and Ukraine has become also a battle between Ukraine’s claim for spiritual independence and Russia’s vision of salvation for ethnic Russians.  In fragile states, such as Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sri Lanka, religious divisions exacerbate strife. Yet, religion has also played a major role in peace-making and conflict resolution.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Our conference will look at the question of religion and conflict. We are cognizant of the gravity of the moment: Religious voices compete in supporting peace and war. Religion is at the heart of political decisions.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>The conference is multidisciplinary and interreligious. Among the topics:</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span>Why and how do religious activists deploy belief to harm and heal? </span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Why do so many perpetrators think their actions are just and holy?</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>How should religious communities remember their violent past or confront their violent present? </span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>What, if anything, separates scholars of religious violence from perpetrators? </span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Is secularism the solution to religious violence or part of the problem?</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>How can religious extremism best be met – religious critique or secular argument?</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Is a commitment to religious pluralism a requirement for a peaceful interpretation of religion?</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>How might believers be equipped to respond to religious violence harder?</span></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>Possible panels: </span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span>Texts of violence/peace</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Causes of religious violence/religious rescue or pacification</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Holiness and justice in the minds of perpetrators/pacifiers</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Teaching about religion and violence/peace in the classroom</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Critiquing one’s own tradition/voice of pluralism in religious traditions</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Characteristics of religious peacemakers</span></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>The list is not exclusive.

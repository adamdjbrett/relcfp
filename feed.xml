			<title>[ June 30, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Phenomenological Workshop on Love and Sexuality</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/112578</link>
						<description><p><strong>Conference Description</strong></p>
<p>Love and sexuality have always occupied an important space within phenomenological discussions of embodiment, intersubjectivity, intentionality, and affect. Unlike psychoanalysis and poststructuralism, phenomenology has always treated sexuality as having existential meaning, treating it as one among multiple fundamental modes of lived experience. In classical phenomenology we find descriptions of sexuality as an "original intentionality" (Merleau-Ponty 2012), an "original mode of realising Being-for-Others" (Sartre 1978), and a "concrete expression of existence" (Beauvoir 1972). And, in the phenomenological tradition, love is considered an important ground for ethics and the apprehension of persons. Beginning with Husserl’s analyses and deepened in the work of Stein, Scheler, Merleau-Ponty, Beauvoir, and more, love apprehends the value of other persons and provides insight into the nature of selfhood. Further, love has traditionally been taken to exemplify intimate forms of we-relations and has been claimed to be required for certain forms of emotional sharing (Scheler 2008).</p>
<p>More recently, scholars have drawn on resources within classical phenomenology to provide comprehensive accounts of sexual difference which further illuminate experiences of trans embodiment and nonnormative sexualities (Rodemeyer 2017, 2018; Salamon 2010; Bettcher 2014; Ahmed 2006). These inroads have been further consolidated by the current ferment of discussions which fall under the heading of 'critical phenomenology'. Critical phenomenological approaches emphasise the importance of bringing phenomenological descriptions into dialogue with perspectives from feminist philosophy, decolonial, latinx, and critical race theory, gender and disability studies, queer theory, and many more. Meanwhile, contemporary phenomenologists of love contend with the question of the nature of romantic love, monogamy and non-monogamies, and heteronormativity.</p>
<p>Within this one-day workshop, we aim to explore, develop, and critically engage with phenomenological descriptions of love and sexuality. We aim to foster dialogue between scholars working on any aspect of love and/or sexuality from a phenomenological perspective. This includes (but is not limited to): desire, sexed embodiment, sexual style(s) and identities, affective intentionality and affective atmospheres, modes of willing and striving, sexual orientation, intimacy, trans* experiences, sexual practices, relationship structures, the roles of empathy and imagination, temporalities, and sexed and gendered differences.</p>

<p>Melville's <em>Moby Dick </em>is a book that defiantly (and perhaps frustratingly) defies a solitary meaning. Indeed, rather than providing readers with a single message in a simple narrative, the text is instead "overflowing" with meaning and the endless possibility of semantic, figurative, literal, and symbolic interpretation. It is, in other words, a text that positively insists upon, and wallows in, a great overabundance. Critics' responses to the text have been, in a similar vein, incredibly varied. The whale itself is, to critics, both a symbol of God and of evil, and still yet, a symbol of theological pursuit, scientific endeavor, ecological collapse, avarice, monomania, and forbiden knowledge. The text's characters are seen as egalitarian preachers, homosexual symbols, and Biblical, or religious figures--sometimes even in the same interpretation. What this panel seeks to investigate is the complex relationships between these multiple meanings of the vast sea of metaphors, symbols, references, and allusions in <em>Moby Dick</em>. How are we to understand this text, and perhaps other texts, which so readily lend themselves to an ostensibly insurmountable variety of interpretations? How might this text inform or contradict our understanding of the concept of "interpretation" itself in literary studies? Is any reading of Melville's text necessarily better than another--and if so, what qualities might set it apart over other interpretations? Or, perhaps taking a step back, is all of this search for meaning, the search for a "true" interpration (or true interpretations) of this text, a monomaniacal, Ahab-ian pursuit of our very own "white whale"?</p>

Concerns about how to handle and dispose of Qur’anic matter – how to use the manuscript, where to place it, when to touch it – or whether it is permissible to perfume it, ingest it or sell it, were among the anxieties of the first centuries of Islam. Formative to the Qur’an’s physical manifestation as codices, scrolls or inscribed artefacts, these debates shaped its sacrality in the material realm and affected the use of Islamic devotional manuscripts in which passages of the Qur’an appear next to other pious texts, prayers or illustrations of holy places. Art history has been rarely concerned with such phenomena, or with the corporeality of sacred and pious texts in general.</span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>This session aims to interrogate the materiality of pious texts and the roles they played in shaping artistic forms embedded in a diverse range of practices, at the time of their production or in their afterlives: Qur’anic calligraphy, calligrams, and emblematic inscriptions in books and scrolls, but also on tablets and panels of various materials, interspersed or combined with devotional texts and images presented in diagrammatic or iconified forms. By moving away from archaeological taxonomies and the study of styles and repertoires, we hope to create space for approaching pious texts through their materiality, their use, and the range of physical reactions they elicited. Meanings – whether religious, political, or aesthetic – can be found not just in how texts looked, but also in how they functioned, and it is through the lens of materiality that previously neglected ideas and behaviors can be examined.</span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>With that in mind, we call for papers that explore the materiality of pious texts of any kind, focusing on how they were shaped, what aesthetic ideas were embedded in them, and what kind of engagement their forms triggered, be it at the time of their making, consumption, alteration, or reuse. As their meanings shifted throughout their spatial and temporal circulation, within and beyond Muslim communities, these texts projected multifaceted statements of faith and efficacy that are yet to be unpacked. Later interventions such as manipulations of their constitutive elements, amendments to their illustrations, or smudging and erasures, also reflect practices and beliefs, often echoing ideologies. In no way limited to these aspects, this session seeks papers that re-instate the role of makers, beholders and users of texts within art history. As such, it encourages cross-disciplinary research – bridging religious studies, anthropology and visual culture – to re-establish the relation between art history, material culture and religion.</span></span></span></div><div> </div><div><span><span><b><u><span>Submission:</span></u></b></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>Please submit your proposal by <b><u>15 </u><strong><span>September 2023 </span></strong></b>via this link: <a href="https://livebyglevents.key4register.com/key4register/AbstractList.aspx?e=148" rel="nofollow">https://livebyglevents.key4register.com/key4register/AbstractList.aspx?e=148</a> </span></span></span></div><div> </div><div><span><span><span>• Title of the proposed paper (concise and reflecting the contents of the paper).</span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>• Paper Proposal: An abstract of 350 to 500 words, in English or French, including 4 to 6 key words and a possible short bibliography.</span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>• CV of 500 characters with first name, last name, title, status, institution of affiliation and the link to the personal or professional page.</span></span></span></div><div> </div><div><span><span><b><u><span>Funding:</span></u></b></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>Applicants are responsible to secure their own funding.

Indeed, rather than providing readers with a single message in a simple narrative, the text is instead "overflowing" with meaning and the endless possibility of semantic, figurative, literal, and symbolic interpretation. It is, in other words, a text that positively insists upon, and wallows in, a great overabundance. Critics' responses to the text have been, in a similar vein, incredibly varied. The whale itself is, to critics, both a symbol of God and of evil, and still yet, a symbol of theological pursuit, scientific endeavor, ecological collapse, avarice, monomania, and forbiden knowledge. The text's characters are seen as egalitarian preachers, homosexual symbols, and Biblical, or religious figures--sometimes even in the same interpretation. What this panel seeks to investigate is the complex relationships between these multiple meanings of the vast sea of metaphors, symbols, references, and allusions in <i>Moby Dick</i>. How are we to understand this text, and perhaps other texts, which so readily lend themselves to an ostensibly insurmountable variety of interpretations? How might this text inform or contradict our understanding of the concept of "interpretation" itself in literary studies? Is any reading of Melville's text necessarily better than another--and if so, what qualities might set it apart over other interpretations? Or, perhaps taking a step back, is all of this search for meaning, the search for a "true" interpration (or true interpretations) of this text, a monomaniacal, Ahab-ian pursuit of our very own "white whale"?<br/><br/>Abstracts due Sep 30. <br/><br/>Submit abstracts to: <br/><a href="https://www.cfplist.com/nemla/Home/S/20408" rel="nofollow">https://www.cfplist.com/nemla/Home/S/20408</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:iaday14@apu.edu">iaday14@apu.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.cfplist.com/nemla/Home/S/20408" target="_blank">https://www.cfplist.com/nemla/Home/S/20408</a></div></div></div></description>

<p><strong>American Literary Naturalism and Religion</strong></p>
<p>Canonical and noncanonical American naturalists evinced a complex and ongoing interest in religious matters. For this panel, jointly organized by the Society for the Study of American Literary Naturalism and the American Religion and Literature Society, we invite scholars to examine American literary naturalism’s engagement with religious ideas and practices. The intersection of American literary naturalism and religion presents a rich area for exploration, offering scholars the opportunity to analyze how authors understood the relationship between the deterministic forces of nature and the religious dimensions of American life.</p>
<p>Potential approaches include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Reevaluation of Naturalist Assumptions – Authors could investigate how American literary naturalism challenges or reinforces traditional religious beliefs, analyzing the ways naturalist narratives engage with questions of morality, free will, and the existence of divinity.</p>
<p>Explore the Religious Dimensions in Naturalist Texts – Authors could examine the presence of religious themes, motifs, and symbolism in naturalistic works, considering how authors negotiated the tension between deterministic natural forces and the religious aspects of human experience.</p>
<p>Authorial Perspectives on Religion – Authors could investigate the beliefs of naturalist authors, exploring how figures such as Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, Jack London, Frank Norris, and Upton Sinclair grapple with or embrace religious ideas in their work.</p>
<p>Comparative Analysis – Authors could compare American literary naturalism with religious texts or explore parallels with religious narratives from other cultural traditions, examining how naturalist perspectives intersect with or diverge from other religious worldviews.</p>
<p>Examine Social and Cultural Contexts – Authors could explore the impact of social and cultural change on the portrayal of religion in American naturalism, investigating how issues such as industrialization, urbanization, and scientific advancements influenced the depiction of religious beliefs in naturalist literature.</p>
<p>Evolution and Religion – Authors could examine how authors engage with religious concepts and practices in the context of evolutionary science, exploring the ways religious ideas are reinterpreted, challenged, or reaffirmed in the face of evolutionary theory. Authors could consider how authors negotiated the tensions between religious faith and the scientific understanding of evolution.</p>
<p>Please submit abstracts of no more than 300 words to <a href="mailto:andrew_ball@emerson.edu">andrew_ball@emerson.edu</a> by <strong>January 15</strong>. Please include a brief biographical note with your submission.</p>

<p><strong>Religious (In)tolerance and Geopolitics in American Literature</strong></p>
<p>This panel seeks to offer a robust and timely discussion about the relationship between religious intolerance and American literature. We are especially interested in papers attuned to transnational and geopolitical frameworks, given the global contexts impacting the resurgence of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in contemporary U.S. culture. While scholars have long noted how American literature has shaped nativist discourses and shifting conceptions of religious difference within the U.S., they have less often attended to the geopolitical contexts underlying these discourses. And yet, our current moment calls us to this work. In this spirit, our panel asks: how have geopolitical events influenced imaginings of religious “others” within the United States? How have U.S. literary representations of religious difference, pluralism, and (in)tolerance shaped discourses on global politics? And more broadly speaking, how has American literature affirmed and/or challenged the notion of religious “tolerance” in and outside of the U.S.? This panel invites papers from across any period of American literature.</p>
<p>Those interested are asked to submit an abstract of no more than 200-300 words and a brief bio of no more than 100 words to <a href="mailto:anamaria.clawson@snc.edu">anamaria.clawson@snc.edu</a> by <strong>January 15</strong>.</p>

<p>“Resilience” is not a word that Emerson used. Yet, there is much in Emerson’s writings about Nature's restorative power, and essays such as “Self-Reliance,” “Circles,” “Experience,” “Power,” “Fate,” “Courage,” and “Character” contain lines of argument that can be read as analogous and perhaps even foundational to our contemporary notions of resilience. As he states in “Courage,” it  “perfect will, which no terrors can shake, which is attracted by frowns and threats or hostile armies, nay, needs these to awake and fan its reserved energies into a pure flame, and is never quite itself until the hazard is extreme; then it is extreme and fertile, and all its powers play well.”</p>
<p>This panel seeks papers that advocate for a reading of Emersonian resilience and that consider how the Transcendentalists responded to personal, political, societal, and technological change in their own time as well as how they influenced later thinkers and movements. Topics might include, but are not limited to, political and social movements such as abolitionism, civil rights, environmentalism, labor reform, or personal trauma.  </p>

<p>Emerson read and thought broadly across religious texts and traditions.

<p>It is well known that William James considered himself to be Ralph Waldo Emerson’s spiritual heir. Their lives were intertwined: Emerson was James’s godfather, and Emerson was so close with the James family that one room in their New York house was designated as “Mr. Emerson’s room” due to frequent visits. James also took an intellectual interest in Emerson. Even early on, as Robert Richardson describes, Emerson “was certainly vividly present in [James’s] imagination.” While James disagreed with many of Emerson’s more transcendental claims, in 1903 William wrote to his brother Henry to exclaim, “Emerson is exquisite!” </p>
<p>This panel seeks papers exploring the interconnections between Emerson and William James.</p>
<p>Topics may include their shared philosophical, religious, or literary perspectives; their transnational influence; biographical connections; philosophical disagreements; or blended comparisons (e.g. “Emerson’s pragmatism” or “James’s transcendentalism”). Papers with interdisciplinary perspectives—philosophy, psychological, ecology, religious studies, etc.—are especially welcome.</p>

			<title>[ January 20, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Models in Theology. Methodical and Theological Paradigm Shifts through Model-Building?</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/117285</link>
						<description><p><strong>Call for Abstracts</strong><br/>Annual Conference of the European Academy of Religion (EuARe2024)</p>
<p><br/><strong>Open Panel: Models in Theology. Methodical and theological paradigm shifts through model-building?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br/>Palermo (Italy)<br/>May 20-23 2024</p>
<p>Models play a crucial role in acquiring scientific knowledge, spanning disciplines from physics to virology, sociology, philosophy, and theology. The historical tradition of model-building in theology dates back to scholastics like Thomas Aquinas. This panel delves into the evolving nature of theological model-building, emphasizing two paradigm shifts. Firstly, it examines changes in the method and content of model-building, posing questions about the unique scientific-theoretical significance of theological models. The need for a distinct theological model theory is highlighted. Secondly, the shift towards innovative approaches in theological models is explored, influenced by encounters with secular philosophical problems and analytical philosophy. The panel aims to address these shifts by investigating the philosophy of science related to theological models and exploring theological peculiarities, using examples like Eucharistic theology and the belief in the Resurrection of the body.</p>
<p><br/>Submissions are welcome from researchers working in systematic theology, philosophy, historical theology, and history of philosophy. Those by early career researchers and individuals who identify as members of groups currently underrepresented academia are especially welcome.</p>
<p><br/>Each accepted speaker will give a short presentation (20 minutes) of their paper, followed by a 10-minute Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Abstracts should not be longer than 500 word</strong> and should <strong>submitted in pdf format as an email to dominik.baumgartner@kaththeol.lmu.de</strong> Please name the file according to the following pattern: short_title_name_affiliation. Submissions must be in English. Submission is also possible via the EuARe2024 Homepage: https://www.europeanacademyofreligion.org/accepted-proposals</p>
<p><br/><strong>Deadline for submission is January 20 2024.</strong></p>
<p><br/>Decisions will be sent out no later than February 05 2024.</p>
<p><br/>Please note that both a valid EuARe membership and registration for the 2024 conference are indispensable for participation in the panel. Registration remains open until April 15th.

						<description>Publication Name: “Thaumàzein” special issue: “Thinking the Ecological Crisis”<br/><br/><p>Editors: Luca Valera (Universidad de Valladolid/Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile), Fiorenza Toccafondi (Università degli Studi di Firenze)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Call for Abstracts - Rivista Thaumàzein</strong> (https://www.rivista.thaumazein.it/index.php/thaum/index)</p>
<p>A global ecological crisis cannot be merely considered as a probable or distant event anymore. Both the ongoing climate change as well as the numerous scientific data available and the amount of published thematic research confirm the fact that we are currently experiencing such a crisis. It is therefore as necessary as ever to approach the present crisis from different points of view and approaches, so as to offer a complex understanding of the issue, avoiding possible scientistic reductionism or simplification.</p>
<p>In this sense, philosophy can still play a key role in helping us to rethink the current ecological crisis, clarifying concepts and paradigms and offering hermeneutical keys to current events. Moreover, philosophy itself could offer pathways and alternatives in order to deal with the ecological crisis in an effective and pragmatic way, guiding political discussion and illuminating possible decisions in this area, both at the particular and national (or international) levels. Because of what has been said so far, this special issue is not intended to offer simply a historical (or historiographical) perspective on the topic of the ecological crisis, but rather a thematic approach to concrete issues associated with ecology. These issues may be approached from different points of view, highlighting the main metaphysical/cosmological, epistemological, ethical, and political issues. In particular, essays addressing the following topics may be welcomed in this special issue:</p>
<p>- ethical issues dealing with technological impact on the environment (e.g., geoengineering, genetic modification of animal and plant species, identification of direct and indirect causes of climate change, etc. ) or with the criteria for assessing actions to mitigate climate change (the usefulness of the distinction intrinsic/instrumental value; the need to rethink the principles of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment or to reevaluate Commoner’s laws of ecology; the relevance of approaches peculiar to deep ecology or ecofeminism, etc.).</p>
<p>- political issues concerning coexistence with other species (e.g., the idea of proposing new forms of “ecological citizenship”); the need to rethink institutional forms of dealing with the climate emergency (such as the proposal to draft a planetary ecological constitution or to amend existing constitutions to adapt them to the new climate demands).</p>
<p>- cosmological, theological, and metaphysical issues concerning the “new ecological paradigm,” such as the relationship between deep ecology and monist immanentism; the influence of Spinoza in current ecological thought; the mutual relationships between pantheism (or panentheism) and the ecological point pf view of prominent contemporary authors (e.g., Naess, Panikkar, Thoreau, Muir, etc.); religious (or theological) forms of thinking about ecology (e.g., the relationship between Buddhism and ecology).  </p>
<p>- epistemological issues regarding the interpretation of data and predictions concerning climate change or the reliability of current scientific instruments.</p>
<p>People interested in these –or similar– topics may send a long abstract (700 words, in English) to: luca.valera@uva.es and fiorenza.toccafondi@unifi.it by February 20th 2024.</p>
<p>We expect that final papers (either in English or Italian) would be around 5,000-7,000 words (please note that neither submission nor acceptance of an abstract is a guarantee of publication). Authors should adapt their papers to the following guidelines: https://www.rivista.thaumazein.it/index.php/thaum/about/submissions#authorGuidelines.</p>
<p>The deadline for the final paper is September 20th, 2024.</p></description>

						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>Author-meets-critics workshop with</p>

<p>Senator Joseph S. Clark Professor of Ethics in Politics and Government at Harvard University</p>
<p><strong>Distinguished Fellow at the Klassik Stiftung Weimar 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shadow of God. <br/></strong><strong>Kant, Hegel, and the Passage from Heaven to History</strong></p>
<p><strong>in Weimar, 16th June 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Once in the West, our lives were bounded by religion. Then we were guided out of the darkness of faith, we are often told, by the cold light of science and reason. To be modern was to reject the religious for the secular and rational. In a bold retelling of philosophical history, Michael Rosen explains the limits of this story, showing that many modern and apparently secular ways of seeing the world were in fact profoundly shaped by religion. The key thinkers, Rosen argues, were the German Idealists, as they sought to reconcile reason and religion. It was central to Kant’s philosophy that, if God is both just and assigns us to heaven or hell for eternity, we must know what is required of us and be able to choose freely. In trying to live moral lives, Kant argued, we are engaged in a collective enterprise as members of a “Church invisible” working together to achieve justice in history. As later Idealists moved away from Kant’s ideas about personal immortality, this idea of “historical immortality” took center stage. Through social projects that outlive us we maintain a kind of presence after death. Conceptions of historical immortality moved not just into the universalistic ideologies of liberalism and revolutionary socialism but into nationalist and racist doctrines that opposed them. But how, after global wars and genocide, can we retain faith in any conception of shared moral progress and, if not, what is to become of the idea of historical immortality? That is our present predicament. A seamless blend of philosophy and intellectual history, <em>The Shadow of God</em> is a profound exploration of secular modernity’s theistic inheritance.</p>

			<title>[Tomorrow] Talk or similar: THE LOGICAL PROBLEM OF EVIL FROM A PARACONSISTENT PERSPECTIVE</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110289</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Itala Maria Loffredo D'Ottaviano (University of Campinas)<br/><br/><p>Dear Colleague,<br/><br/>You are invited to participate in the next session of the Logic and Religion Webinar Series which will be held on <strong>April 13 (Thursday), 2023</strong>, at <strong>4pm CET</strong> with the topic:</p>
<p><strong>THE LOGICAL PROBLEM OF EVIL FROM A PARACONSISTENT PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Itala Maria Loffredo D'Ottaviano (University of Campinas, Brazil).<strong><br/>Chair:</strong> Evandro Gomes (State University of Maringá, Brazil).</p>
<p>Please, register in advance to access the zoom link:<br/>https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars</p>
<p> <br/>Abstract: After a brief discussion on the presence of <u>paraconsistent approaches in the history of Western thought</u>, in special in ancient and medieval times, we will characterize paraconsistent logic, created only during the 20th century. Recently, <u>Bertato (2021)</u> presented a proposal for a Formal Natural Theology through a first-order logical theory, by formally introducing fundamental concepts such as divine, necessary, and supreme. In this presentation, based on Bertato’s system, we will propose a paraconsistent underlying approach to deal with the Logical Problem of Evil, such that the presence of contradictions does not lead to logical triviality.</p>
<p>Join us 5 minutes prior to the beginning of the session!<br/> <br/>With best wishes,</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>Francisco de Assis Mariano <br/>The University of Missouri-Columbia<br/>LARA Secretary</p></description>

Charles demanded that puritans change voting practices, baptismal policies, and laws, and he also cast an eye on local resources such as forests, a valuable source of masts for the English navy. In the face of this threat to local rule, colonists had to decide whether they would submit to the commissioners’ authority, which they viewed as arbitrary because it was not accountable to the people, or whether they would mobilize to defy the crown.</span></p><p><span>Those resisting the crown included not just freemen (voters) but also people often seen as excluded or marginalized such as non-freemen, indentured servants, and women. Together they crafted a potent regional constitutional culture in defiance of Charles II that was characterized by a skepticism of metropolitan ambition, a defense of civil and religious liberties, and a conviction that self-government was divinely sanctioned.</span></p><p><span>The event is free to all, but registration is required via this link: </span><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FXyxEovIRASqkdZXmkR5Mg" rel="nofollow"><span>https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FXyxEovIRASqkdZXmkR5Mg</span></a></p><p><span>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.</span></p><p><span>For more information, please email <a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org?subject=A%20Constitutional%20Culture">info@14beacon.org</a>.</span></p><p><br/><span><strong>SPEAKER BIO</strong></span></p><p><strong>Adrian Chastain Weimer</strong> is Professor of History at Providence College.

<p>Submissions are open to advanced graduate students (ABD or equivalent) and early career recent PhD recipients (within three years of receiving their PhD who have not secured a tenure-track position). Applicants should be able to demonstrate interdisciplinary knowledge and training appropriate to their research proposal.</p>

What about the religious dimension of China’s deepening entanglements with the world? Religion is central to the culture and national identity of most BRI and adjacent countries, and, often, their political system and ideology as well. These religions include Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox Christianity, among others. What are the religious implications and consequences of these circulations and frictions? The growing presence of China in countries of the Global South may increase the importance of China in the imagination, strategies, or missionizing goals of religious organizations, movements, political parties and ideologies in those countries. These imaginations, strategies and identity formations may be inflected by a resurfacing of historical imaginations and networks. At the same time, growing links offer opportunities for the international expansion of Chinese religious and spiritual networks and organizations. This increased circulation may impact on China’s religious ecology and complicate China’s internal religious policy as well as its management of religious exchanges in the service of diplomacy and soft power.</p><p>This international conference will bring together scholars working on different regions and disciplines, to map out the contours of the religious dimensions and implications of Global China, through discussion of empirical studies and testing of different analytical frameworks.</p><p>Scholars are invited to submit paper proposals on empirical studies touching on one or more of the following topics:</p><ul><li>The circulation and penetration of religious networks, personnel and practices between China and other countries, including countries of the BRI and beyond, including through migration, trade or missionary movements;</li><li>Religious entanglements and responses to Chinese-invested infrastructure projects;</li><li>Evolving religious and civilizational discourses, identities and imaginaries as a consequence of intensified relationships between China and other nations;</li><li>State management and control, whether by China or other countries, of increased religious flows in a context of securitization and geopolitical tensions;</li><li>Religious factors in national politics or geopolitics involving China.</li></ul><p>The conference will be held both in-person, at the University of Hong Kong on 17-18 August, and online, hosted by the Asia Research Institute on 22-23 August.</p><p><strong>The conference is generously supported by the project <a href="https://asiar.hku.hk/brinfaith/home/" rel="nofollow"><em>Infrastructures of Faith: Religious Mobilities on the Belt and Road</em> (BRINFAITH)</a> at the Asian Religious Connections research cluster of the Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences (HKIHSS), University of Hong Kong, and jointly organized by HKIHSS; Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore; and Center for Global Asia, New York University Shanghai.</strong></p><p><br/><strong>SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS</strong></p><p>Paper proposals should include a title, an abstract (250 words maximum) and a brief personal biography of 100 words for submission. Please use the <a href="https://ari.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CFP-Proposal-Form_Global-China-Religious-World.docx" rel="nofollow">paper proposal form</a> and send it as a word document file to <a href="mailto:asiar@hku.hk">asiar@hku.hk</a> by <strong>20 April 2023</strong>.

One resonant factor in the rituals of prayer offered in contemporary Africa is how the context of physical insecurity, social instability, and economic precarity have penetrated through and shaped its content and rites. Our responses to the challenges of underdevelopment and weakness of state political apparatuses through the instrumentality of prayer have configured daily life around militarization. Despite the pervasiveness of prayer as a form of warfare against extant reality, this spectacular practice that reverberates through the cultural landscape in Africa and beyond has not received enough scholarly attention. Militarized prayers, aimed at cosmic forces perceived to be militating against social progress, are initiatives toward addressing existential realities. They demonstrate African cosmological insights into the mechanisms of world-ordering and agency of those who want to re-order it. Warfare prayers are thus worth understanding on these terms. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This conference calls for papers that engage the sort of world Africans build when they employ prayers as a form of warfare. How do these forms of prayers re-order personal, social, and political life? What cultural understanding of the nature of reality drives these prayers? How do these prayers integrate the physical and psychic with the political? What is the nexus between prayer performance, pleasures, and political practices?  This interdisciplinary conference welcomes presentations that engage these questions and many more from scholars, theologians, postgraduate students, and members of faith communities. This study is not limited to any religious traditions. We welcome presentations from across a broad spectrum of faith practices. Please send in abstracts/proposals of not more than 250 words and proposals by June 24, 2023 to: </span></span></span><a href="mailto:violentprayersconference@gmail.com"><span><span><span>violentprayersconference@gmail.com</span></span></span></a><u><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></u></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Papers are expected from these subthemes but are not limited to:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Typologies of prayer practices within and across religious spectrum</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Theoretical conceptions of prayers and social militarization</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Comparative religious perspectives on prayer and social militarization</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Historical study of prayer and social militarization</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Methodological approaches to prayer and social militarization</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ethical issues in warfare prayer </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Popular culture, prayer, and prayer warfare</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Spaces, places, and prayer as warfare</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Politics, democracy, and notions of power in prayer </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Urban culture and prayer warfare </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Language and poetics of prayer warfare</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Language, literature and creativity in prayer warfare</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Gender issues in prayer warfare</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Technology, medium, and warfare prayers</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Warfare prayers and shaping of social imaginary</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Performance, sacred objects, and rituals of warfare prayers </span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ul><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Conference Date: 24</span><span>th </span><span>– 27</span><span>th </span><span>July, 2023. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Venue: The Redeemed Christian Bible College, Redemption Camp, Mowe, Ogun State. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note: This conference has a virtual component for international participants</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><a href="mailto:violentprayersconference@gmail.com">violentprayersconference@gmail.com</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:adelakun@austin.utexas.edu">adelakun@austin.utexas.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

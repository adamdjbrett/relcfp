			<title>[ June 6, 2024 -  June 9, 2024] Conference or similar: Touching the World - Luce Irigaray Circle &amp; NSU</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/115538</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The 12th meeting of the Luce Irigaray Circle is a three-day interdisciplinary conference devoted to the scholarship and creative work on, or inspired by, the thought of Luce Irigaray. Luce Irigaray’s work has influenced scholarship across multiple fields including Philosophy, Gender Studies, Queer Theory, Trans Studies, Literary and Culture Studies, Indigenous Studies, Classics, Religious Studies, Political Theory, Linguistics, Art, Architecture, Music, Performance Studies, and Legal Theory, etc. The Circle cultivates a space for honoring and interrogating the question of sexual difference by supporting the multiple research trajectories, methods, and projects inspired by Irigaray’s thought.</p>
<p>Luce Irigaray has called for a new human being and a new way of thinking based on her philosophy of sexual difference. Central to this idea of being and thinking are touch and being touched as forms of interaction and inter-affections that are endless processes of becoming and transformations. This year´s conference draws its theme from touching and being touched by the world in all its manifestations. Reflections on the following topics are welcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexes, genders, differences</li>
<li>New human being and humanity</li>
<li>Sharing desire, sharing the world</li>
<li>Erotic thinking</li>
<li>Embodiments and languaging</li>
<li>Ethics of sexual difference</li>
<li>Temporalities and spatialities</li>
<li>Vegetal thinking, breath and breathing</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Self-affection and the sensible transcendental</li>
<li>Liberation and repression</li>
<li>Race and racism</li>
<li>Disconnection, coloniality, war</li>
<li>Climate change</li>
<li>Capitalism as patriarchal economy and polarization</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers should be delivered in 20 minutes to leave 10 minutes each for discussion. Please note that the IC conference organizers are planning an edited volume based on the conference and request the right of first review on all accepted papers. If you would like to submit a proposal, please send the following information at https://forms.gle/CJDHLwiWaCwuyx1d6 by January 10th, 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>For individual papers and works in progress: the title of your paper, an abstract (500 words maximum); 5 keywords; a list of no more than six references (not to be included in the word count)</li>
<li>For complete panels (approx. 3 papers per panel): the title of the panel; an abstract explaining the theme of the panel (300 words maximum); 5 keywords for the panel; titles and individual abstracts for each paper (300 words each maximum, plus a list of up to six references for each paper).</li>
</ul>
<p>Creative Work:</p>
<p>In addition to academic presentations, the Circle invites proposals for creative work related to the work of Luce Irigaray. Past events have included theatrical and musical performances, poetry readings, art installations, and more. Submissions should include an abstract describing the work, materials that represent it (for example, poetry excerpts or photos) and an explanation of the technical needs related to presenting the work.</p>
<p>Work-in-Progress Session(s):</p>
<p>In addition to traditional academic presentations, we welcome works and thinking in progress. If you would prefer to participate in a closed discussion section for works in progress, indicate “Works in Progress” in the subject line of your submission. If you are admitted to the works in progress track, we will ask you to send in an unfinished piece of writing (non-academic as well as academic texts are welcome) ahead of the conference (by 1st of May 2024), which will be shared with others who have signed up to join the WIP-session(s).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Universalized, secular and democratic post-modern societies, under the aegis of unbridled freedom and limitless growth, are leading us today, more than ever, to reinterrogate man's relationship with his beliefs in his biocenosis. Thinking of the sacred, the spiritual, the religious, from an absolute point of view, involves a semantic, semiotic and implex mental hierarchy understood in a dichotomous relationship focused on paradigmatic dyads:</p>
<p> city / countryside</p>
<p> nature / culture</p>
<p> civilization / barbarism</p>
<p> deep country / imaginary country</p>
<p> dream country / real country</p>
<p> autochthony / universality</p>
<p> universal / diversel (pluriversal)</p>
<p> emic point of view (from within the social group) / etic point of view (from the observer's point of view)</p>
<p>The relationship between these terms depends on one's perspective. We must recognize that there is a differentiation between the terms sacred/spiritual/religious, but also that it is difficult to establish a boundary between them.</p>
<p>To begin with, we know that the sacred is a particular status linked to myths that refers to the subject, to essence, to ontological depth and its relationship to the divine sphere, to the notion of interiority, of nature, of innateness; it is characterized by the active power of divinity, that feeling of absolute presence, of divine presence. It is both mystery and terror. It is the being of nature, living in the present moment, whereas religion, inseparable from society, brings us back to the concept of culture, of what has been acquired, keeping us in the past and projecting us into the future. It is thought of as a human experience, an external construct, it becomes an object of knowledge, part of collective worship, and in the light of historical evolution, it leads to a cosmetic approach to the world (colonialist, transhumanist...), a dispossession of the characteristics of the human being, or even a projection of the human ideal into an imaginary world.</p>
<p>Spirituality, the preferred domain of the human sciences, also concerns all those who survey the territory of the mind, and is approached with circumspection, with the difficult neutrality that falls to rational, Cartesian minds. In such matters, any system of thought, any attempt at conceptualization is confronted with the irreducible complexity of a protean reality that transcends the field of discourse.</p>
<p>As for religion, it can be understood as any specific system of belief, worship, etc., often implying a moral code, whereas spirituality - which is not exclusive of religion, since atheistic, secular or pagan spirituality can be found - focuses on things and the immaterial world, the world of spirits. It implies a quest, a questioning, a path, a reason. That said, this belief system is rarely unanimous, and in the history of mankind has regularly been involved in conflicts whose intensity demonstrates that the sharing of the sacred does not always overlap with the "sharing of the sensible". In regions of the world where various cultural practices come into contact, exchanges and new creations resulting from appropriations and re-appropriations offer a most interesting subject for study, and invite us to rethink the paradigms of syncretism and super-syncretism (Benítez-Rojo, 2010).</p>
<p>Conceptually, these notions - sacred, spiritual, religious - are associated with a diversity of representations which, in the collective imagination, rarely carry the same semantic, semiological or even gnostic weight in literature, science, the arts and cultural practices. Do they refer to the same meanings in terms of the scholarly observer's reception of the cult communities and cultural ethopoeias, of the theocratic ecosystems he is targeting? From a civilizational point of view, what cultural shocks, or relational ecologies, do they provide access to?</p>
<p>The worlds of literary and artistic creation in the South are precisely scriptural, oracular, sonic, hermetic or heterogeneous worlds where language, the Word, resonance, cosmic energy... are created, and where we tend to reconfigure these terminologies. What, then, of literature and the arts? How do novelists, poets and artists reintegrate or re-appropriate these lost frequential spaces of the Republic of Human Sciences? Are aesthetic strategies, however minimal, perceptible, conceivable or tangible?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How to contribute</strong></p>
<p>As these lines of inquiry are not intended to be exhaustive, contributors are encouraged to explore other aspects of the issue along the conceptual lines indicated.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Overview of the journal:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have launched our new journal, <em>The Classical Connection</em>, and are asking for contributions for our debut issue to be published by the end of this year. The underlying principle of the journal is that “The Great Conversation” is still occurring, and we can participate in it. We hope this is a two-way conversation, simultaneously asking, “What role should the premodern play in the post-postmodern era?” and “What insights do we have now that might speak toward the questions of the past?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>-       Can current psychological studies give us insight into events of the past?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the psyche? What is consciousness?</li>
</ul>
<p>-       Might Augustine have something useful to say about the free will debate?</p>
<p>-       Why is the Battle of Salamis still useful for military study despite the technological disparity?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though our perspective is Christian, and we believe that the story of the West is permanently intertwined with Christianity, we accept submissions on a range of topics, both secular and religious, regardless of belief system. Our goal is to facilitate robust, academically rigorous, useful conversation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Outside of our content, we have some distinctives that separate us from other academic journals:</p>
<p>-       <strong>Unique style guide</strong>: when one reads the academic work of Tolkien or Lewis, or anyone else from the mid-20th century or earlier, it’s clear that the rigid academic structure was less essential than the content itself. We hope to move back toward this and encourage accessible yet intelligent conversational prose. Please review our style guide before submission for further details.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Charitability:</strong> We are not interested in publishing things that strip away meaning from the world rather than adding it. As such, there are many scholarly topics that would not be suitable for our journal. For example, the sort of literary criticism where the impression is given that the critic simply hates literature. Alternatively, any sort of inquiry that only focuses on the evils of a particular person, nation, or thought system without any sort of nuanced counterweight. In short, culture theorists say that we’re past the postmodern mockery and cynicism, so academia needs to begin to reflect that.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Streamlined Review:</strong> Contributors to most special issues will be asked to review 1-2 other papers being published in that issue, with a 2-week turnaround time. We will also solicit from our network of reviewers to provide outside expertise as necessary along the same timeline. We don’t want the publication process to be delayed by the review process, and we’ve never gotten (or given) a review so comprehensive that it couldn’t have been done in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Free to publish, free to view:</strong> We are an institutionally funded open-access journal that does not charge a publication fee. Publication costs and viewing costs are academic barriers to entry that simply should not exist in the digital age.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Special issue only</strong>: Currently, we are a special issue-only journal and do not accept open submissions. If you’re interested in pitching a special issue and serving as a guest editor for it, please contact the managing editor Michael Barros at <a href="mailto:m.barros@boiseclassicalacademy.com">m.barros@boiseclassicalacademy.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Information about the flagship issue:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The theme of our flagship issue is “Christian Bogeymen,” and the articles will explore the compatibility/relationship of various hot-button topics with Christianity. More precisely, this issue will investigate controversial topics that have either been claimed to be incompatible with Christianity or been used in polemics against Christianity. Topics like evolution, the Big Bang, and so on have become bogeymen to the Christian community when they need not be. These major topics, as well as many that are periphery to Christian thought, are what we’re categorizing as “bogeymen” for this issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Note: The goal is not for this to be an apologetic issue but rather a communique to the Christian community.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently, we have commitments for the following topics:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-       The history of the Big Bang theory and its compatibility with Christianity.</p>
<p>-       The utility of contemporary Halloween celebrations.</p>
<p>-       The problem of evil: Augustine and Jonothan Edwards</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some other possible topics might be:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-       Do Christians need to be comfortable with all Christian doctrine?</p>
<p>-       How damning is the problem of evil?   </p>
<p>-       Can Christians celebrate Halloween?</p>
<p>-       The history and development of Halloween.</p>
<p>-       Why Christians can and should read pagan literature.</p>
<p>-       Why Christians shouldn’t get hung up on the evolution debate when reading Genesis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Publication timeline:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Note: This is an experimental issue that is also serving as a proof of concept for our board, so we’ve condensed the timeline. As a result, the peer review process will not be distributed. Instead, we’ll use reviewers in our network who’ve already agreed. This means we will be rather limited on articles we can accept, so it’ll have to be a first come, first served sort of thing. </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>We also have a Christmas issue planned with a longer deadline. Please check the website for more information.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>-       Manuscripts (3,500-4,500 words) due Saturday, 14 October</p>
<p>-       Papers returned with reviewer comments Friday, 20 October</p>
<p>-       Revised papers due Friday, 27 October</p>
<p>-       Final editorial review will take place on Sunday, 29 October</p>
<ul>
<li>Please check your e-mail that night just in case there are some last-minute changes</li>
</ul>
<p>-       Publication date: 31 October</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For now, please e-mail submissions to <a href="mailto:m.barros@boiseclassicalacademy.com">m.barros@boiseclassicalacademy.com</a></p>

</p><p>The Religion in the Global Age panel at the International Society for Religion, Literature and Culture seeks papers that address the conference theme of "The Irreplacable Human/-ities?" within the framework of the analytic, scientific, or critical study of religion. In this panel, preference is given to papers focussed on comparative studies <strong>or</strong> on specific religions in the Global Age not otherwise represented by existing ISRLC panels. </p>
<p>The ir/replicability of the human is a restatement of a much older question of human distinctiveness, in which the human stands in contrast to “nature” or “the natural”, and religion has played a key role in creating and maintaining the discursive separation between the two. With technological advances introducing “the mechanical”, the binary relationship between the human and the natural has been reconfigured. Religious responses to this reconfiguration have varied widely, and for the 2024 conference, we invite papers which consider this reconfiguration from any vantage point within the remit of ISRLC. We are particularly interested in papers which address:</p>
<ul>
<li>religion and online culture, particularly with reference to</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>religious subcultures which coalesce through social media</li>
<li>inter-religious dialogue and/or dispute in the digital space</li>
<li>conspiracy thinking </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>pre-digital imaginations of the post-human </li>
<li>approaches to or depictions of the relationship between “humanity” and “nature” which reach beyond the historical binary configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>Queries and abstract proposals of no more than 350 words should be sent to Alana Vincent (Umeå University) at <a href="mailto:alana.vincent@umu.se">alana.vincent@umu.se</a> no later than 15 December 2023</p>

			<title>[ April 18, 2023] Talk or similar: The Earliest Latin Maimonides, the “Reasons for the Commandments,” and the Perfection of the Soul</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110369</link>
						<description>Venue: 17 Rue de la Sorbonne<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Lucy Pick<br/><br/><p>In her talk, Lucy Pick will present some of her discoveries about the earliest Latin translation of Moses Maimonides’ <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em>, which is found in the <em>Liber de parabolis et mandatis</em>, a text from 1223–24 that prefaces a translation of Book III, 29–49 of the <em>Guide</em> on the reasons for the commandments, with an introductory explanation and demonstration of allegorical exegesis. This demonstration not only instructs its readers in the methods of exegesis, it also develops a picture that seems to derive from Avicenna of the human soul, riven by conflicting influences but capable of perfection. She will discuss this introduction and ask why this fascinating text, which she attributes to the joint work of Samuel ibn Tibbon (translator of the <em>Guide</em> from Arabic to Hebrew) and Michael Scot (known for his translations from Arabic into Latin), pairs such an argument with Maimonides’ discussion of the rational and historical reasons for the commandments.</p></description>

			<title>[ May 11, 2023] Talk or similar: Hume on Hypotheses and Enlightenment Epistemology of Religion</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110377</link>
						<description>Venue: Grodzka 52<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Gianenrico Paganini<br/><br/><p><strong>Abstract<br/><br/></strong>The experimental theist Cleanthes and the skeptical Philo in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Epicurus in the oration of the First Enquiry, deal all with the same problem and endorse the same epistemology. Both the method and the argument come from Newton’s Principia: the former derives from the famous regulae philosophandi and the argument from the Scholium generale appended to the third book of the Principia. Not only the theologians of the Boyle lectures, but Newton himself, in the Scholium generale, had established a close connection between the use of induction, the rejection of hypotheses, the argument from of design or final causes, and the conception of a "living, intelligent, powerful being”, that governs the world as a Lord. It is notable that Newton did not hesitate to include God among the objects of “natural philosophy”. The Dialogues represent a challenge to this “experimental theism” inspired by Newton, but also they aim at rehabilitating the function of hypotheses, against Newton’s famous veto, albeit in a new form that is compatible with the scepticism endorsed by the protagonist of the work, Philo. This new reading of the Dialogues centred on Philo’s “hypotheticism” also sheds more light on the meaning and scope of the work.</p></description>

The Greek Patriarch of Constantinople – Saint Hieromartyr, as of January 2022 – owes most of his enduring fame to a “Calvinist” Confession of Faith that was published in Geneva, first in Latin, in 1629, then in Greek, with additions, in 1633. Translated into French, English, German, and Italian, and re-edited several times, this laconic text triggered passionate debates across Europe, forcing Eastern Christianity to address theological issues never tackled before. Yet there is much more to Loukaris than his Confession of Faith, as the first ORTHPOL Conference will show.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Taking recent scholarship on Loukaris as starting point and favouring a source-oriented approach, the project members and their guests will discuss the catalytic role played by the controversial Patriarch in the making of Eastern Orthodoxy.

Nichols</a> (University of California, Santa Barbara)</span></p><hr/><h3>ABOUT</h3><p>The detrimental effects of carbon-based fuel sources, including and especially their contribution to anthropogenic climate change, has motivated scientists to develop alternative renewable energy solutions. Among those, nuclear power has been the most highly contested because of the associated risks to the health and stability of ecological systems. Many scientists argue that a carbon-neutral energy future is not feasible without the continued development of nuclear power technologies.</p><p>Anti-nuclear activists, however, have long argued that the potential associated dangers to the health and stability of ecological systems make nuclear power an unnecessarily risky response to the global energy crisis. They have expressed concerns, e.g., about the elevated risks of nuclear contamination incidents as global sea levels rise and threaten a majority of the world’s extant nuclear facilities and interim storage sites. Moreover, activists are increasingly concerned about social and environmental justice issues and the transgenerational effects of nuclear waste spills and radiation incidents on both human and ecosystem health and viability. </p><p>The nuclear debate raises many complicated questions at the intersection of ethics and technological innovation of our time, including ‘What are the long-term social and environmental justice implications of nuclear technologies when we consider the effects on both human and non-human species?’.</p><hr/><h3>THEMES</h3><p>The conference theme, “Global Legacies of Anti-Nuclear Activism: Intersectional Perspectives”  is a direct invitation to those scholars working on the following:</p><ul><li><p>Historical approaches that shed light on specific movements, individuals, groups, actions, or research/discoveries that have made significant contributions to the anti-nuclear movement, especially those from minority perspectives and/or those with transnational or gender implications, and the reactions they triggered in society, domestic and international politics, and regulatory changes; </p></li><li><p>Contemporary approaches (impacted by specific politics of memory) that shape current understandings and discourses about nuclear technologies and their critics;</p></li><li><p>Illuminating and minimizing disparity, inequality, and inequity in the research, development, and utilization of nuclear technologies; </p></li><li><p>Inquiries into the intersection of religion, gender, sexuality, and embodiment with the construction of scientific and technological forms of knowledge and the rhetoric of nuclear technologies;</p></li><li><p>Ethical critiques and compatibility of nuclear technologies (including nuclear weapons, power, waste, and storage) with environmental and social justice, indigenous rights perspectives, and religious/ethical or secular/scientific perspectives; </p></li><li><p>Public education and empowerment of individuals and communities with the tools and resources (e.g., political, social, environmental, economic, etc.) necessary for protecting themselves and their environments; </p></li><li><p>Approaches that consider the effects of nuclear technologies on non-human species and ecological and planetary systems; </p></li><li><p>Intersections with capitalism, extractivism, disposability, necropolitics, and ‘throw-away culture’; </p></li><li><p>Emerging nuclear technologies and approaches focused on creating resilient energy futures based on recent climate science data and public resistance; </p></li><li><p>Identifying and understanding the intersectional effects and social and environmental justice concerns of global energy transitions;</p></li><li><p>Engagement of nuclear technologies and post-truth technologies (social media, misinformation, science denial, conspiracy); </p></li><li><p>Artistic expressions and other forms of cultural manifestations of the (anti-) nuclear discourse, i.e., future visions and worldmaking, nuclear technologies in science fiction, dystopia, utopia, apocalypticism, Afro-futurism, Afro-pessimism, and promised, unrealized, and emerging human and non-human futures;</p></li><li><p>Nuclear technologies and planetary boundaries, especially as they intersect with matters of race, gender, and social and environmental justice.</p></li></ul><p>We also invite other proposals that fit broadly within the conference theme.</p><hr/><h3>PROPOSALS</h3><p>We welcome proposals from scholars working on intersectional approaches to global anti-nuclear activism in historical and contemporary perspective across the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences for a multi-day conference and writer’s workshop which will be held at the University of California, Santa Barbara in April 2024. </p><p>Selected participants will submit papers that will be pre-circulated among participants of a workshop in Santa Barbara, where they will engage with fellow participants and invited guest speakers and workshop their contributions for a peer-reviewed edited volume published with a university press.</p><hr/><h3><strong>TO APPLY</strong></h3><p>Please submit a 150-word abstract and a 500-1,000 word proposal via our conference website <a href="http://www.antinuclearactivism.org/" rel="nofollow">www.antinuclearactivism.org</a> <strong>by June 15, 2023</strong>.  </p><p>Decisions will be communicated to all applicants by <strong>August 31, 2023</strong>.</p><p>If you have further questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:mail@antinuclearactivism.org">mail@antinuclearactivism.org</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><u><strong>Conveners:</strong></u></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.maklimke.com/" rel="nofollow">Martin Klimke</a> (New York University Abu Dhabi)</li><li><a href="https://es.ucsb.edu/people/amanda-m-nichols" rel="nofollow">Amanda M.

<p> </p>
<p>Established in 1968 as a direct result of Black student struggle on campus, the Black Studies Department—now Africana Studies Department— at San Francisco State University was the first Black Studies department in the nation. The establishment of the department also marked the institutionalization Black Studies “as a ‘scientific discipline’ rooted in racial redemption, liberatory scholarship and community revitalization, the discipline of Africana Studies is a body of systematized knowledge, theories, methods, and laws, which are congruent with the African centered paradigm and philosophy.” (Tshaka, 2012, p 29).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sixty years later, Black Studies—and all its colloquiums such as African American Studies, Africana Studies, Africology, African Diasporic Studies—has seen much growth and evolution in the field. It is in this vein that this work seeks to critically engage subjects relevant to people of African descent in the 21st century, from an African centered perspective.</p>

			<title>[ November 13, 2023] Conference or similar: Phenomenological Workshop on Love and Sexuality</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110321</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p><strong>Conference Description</strong></p>
<p>Love and sexuality have always occupied an important space within phenomenological discussions of embodiment, intersubjectivity, intentionality, and affect. Unlike psychoanalysis and poststructuralism, phenomenology has always treated sexuality as having existential meaning, treating it as one among multiple fundamental modes of lived experience. In classical phenomenology we find descriptions of sexuality as an "original intentionality" (Merleau-Ponty 2012), an "original mode of realising Being-for-Others" (Sartre 1978), and a "concrete expression of existence" (Beauvoir 1972). And, in the phenomenological tradition, love is considered an important ground for ethics and the apprehension of persons. Beginning with Husserl’s analyses and deepened in the work of Stein, Scheler, Merleau-Ponty, Beauvoir, and more, love apprehends the value of other persons and provides insight into the nature of selfhood. Further, love has traditionally been taken to exemplify intimate forms of we-relations and has been claimed to be required for certain forms of emotional sharing (Scheler 2008).</p>
<p>More recently, scholars have drawn on resources within classical phenomenology to provide comprehensive accounts of sexual difference which further illuminate experiences of trans embodiment and nonnormative sexualities (Rodemeyer 2017, 2018; Salamon 2010; Bettcher 2014; Ahmed 2006). These inroads have been further consolidated by the current ferment of discussions which fall under the heading of 'critical phenomenology'. Critical phenomenological approaches emphasise the importance of bringing phenomenological descriptions into dialogue with perspectives from feminist philosophy, decolonial, latinx, and critical race theory, gender and disability studies, queer theory, and many more. Meanwhile, contemporary phenomenologists of love contend with the question of the nature of romantic love, monogamy and non-monogamies, and heteronormativity.</p>
<p>Within this one-day workshop, we aim to explore, develop, and critically engage with phenomenological descriptions of love and sexuality. We aim to foster dialogue between scholars working on any aspect of love and/or sexuality from a phenomenological perspective. This includes (but is not limited to): desire, sexed embodiment, sexual style(s) and identities, affective intentionality and affective atmospheres, modes of willing and striving, sexual orientation, intimacy, trans* experiences, sexual practices, relationship structures, the roles of empathy and imagination, temporalities, and sexed and gendered differences.</p>

As a research-oriented program in English, it provides a cross-epochal understanding of Mediterranean societies.</p><p><b>Explore the liquid continent!</b> As the contact zone of Africa, Asia and Europe, the Mediterranean is a 'liquid continent' (Gabriel Audisio) where boundaries of domination and settlement, culture, religion and language have repeatedly shifted in different directions. The region is today of outstanding importance for migration and tourism, ecology and cultural heritage, conflict and dialogue between cultures and religions. Many current problems of the Mediterranean region reach far back into the past and can therefore only be understood in a perspective of long duration. Against this background, the international master’s program reconstructs the profound changes and global interdependencies of the Mediterranean region across epochs. </p><p>The globally unique study program provides BA graduates in history and cultural studies with in-depth knowledge of the history, cultures and languages of Mediterranean societies. At the same time, they acquire practical skills and regional expertise that are urgently needed not only in academia, but also by the numerous institutions, organizations and companies that are active in and cooperate with the region. </p><p>About the MA Program Mediterranean History, visit the webpage at<br/><a href="https://www.geschichte.uni-konstanz.de/en/study/ma-mediterranean-history/prospective-students/" rel="nofollow">https://www.geschichte.uni-konstanz.de/en/study/ma-mediterranean-history/prospective-students/</a><br/><br/>If you would like to learn more about the MA program, join the information event at the following webpages</p><p>Zoom Information Event: 20th April 2023, 03:00 PM (CET)<br/><a href="https://uni-konstanz-de.zoom.us/j/99395107302?pwd=c3NFVFVnanJ4ay90enl6ZXBxNGpRUT09#success" rel="nofollow">https://uni-konstanz-de.zoom.us/j/99395107302?pwd=c3NFVFVnanJ4ay90enl6ZXBxNGpRUT09#success</a><br/>Meeting ID: 993 9510 7302<br/>Passcode: 059845</p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Dr. Jovo Miladinović</p><p>Universität Konstanz<br/>FB Geschichte und Soziologie<br/>Neuere und Neueste Geschichte<br/>Fach 6<br/>78457 Konstanz</p><p>Raum F 357</p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:jovo.miladinovic@uni-konstanz.de">jovo.miladinovic@uni-konstanz.de</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/study/before-you-study/study-programmes/study-programmes-a-z/mediterranean-history-ma/" target="_blank">https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/study/before-you-study/study-programmes/study-programmes-a-z/mediterranean-history-ma/</a></div></div></div></description>

						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>Author-meets-critics workshop with</p>
<p><strong>Michael Rosen</strong></p>
<p>Senator Joseph S. Clark Professor of Ethics in Politics and Government at Harvard University</p>
<p><strong>Distinguished Fellow at the Klassik Stiftung Weimar 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shadow of God. <br/></strong><strong>Kant, Hegel, and the Passage from Heaven to History</strong></p>
<p><strong>in Weimar, 16th June 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Once in the West, our lives were bounded by religion. Then we were guided out of the darkness of faith, we are often told, by the cold light of science and reason. To be modern was to reject the religious for the secular and rational. In a bold retelling of philosophical history, Michael Rosen explains the limits of this story, showing that many modern and apparently secular ways of seeing the world were in fact profoundly shaped by religion. The key thinkers, Rosen argues, were the German Idealists, as they sought to reconcile reason and religion. It was central to Kant’s philosophy that, if God is both just and assigns us to heaven or hell for eternity, we must know what is required of us and be able to choose freely. In trying to live moral lives, Kant argued, we are engaged in a collective enterprise as members of a “Church invisible” working together to achieve justice in history. As later Idealists moved away from Kant’s ideas about personal immortality, this idea of “historical immortality” took center stage. Through social projects that outlive us we maintain a kind of presence after death. Conceptions of historical immortality moved not just into the universalistic ideologies of liberalism and revolutionary socialism but into nationalist and racist doctrines that opposed them. But how, after global wars and genocide, can we retain faith in any conception of shared moral progress and, if not, what is to become of the idea of historical immortality? That is our present predicament. A seamless blend of philosophy and intellectual history, <em>The Shadow of God</em> is a profound exploration of secular modernity’s theistic inheritance.</p>

<p>Senator Joseph S. Clark Professor of Ethics in Politics and Government at Harvard University</p>
<p><strong>Distinguished Fellow at the Klassik Stiftung Weimar 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shadow of God. <br/></strong><strong>Kant, Hegel, and the Passage from Heaven to History</strong></p>
<p><strong>in Weimar, 16th June 2023</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Once in the West, our lives were bounded by religion. Then we were guided out of the darkness of faith, we are often told, by the cold light of science and reason. To be modern was to reject the religious for the secular and rational. In a bold retelling of philosophical history, Michael Rosen explains the limits of this story, showing that many modern and apparently secular ways of seeing the world were in fact profoundly shaped by religion. The key thinkers, Rosen argues, were the German Idealists, as they sought to reconcile reason and religion. It was central to Kant’s philosophy that, if God is both just and assigns us to heaven or hell for eternity, we must know what is required of us and be able to choose freely. In trying to live moral lives, Kant argued, we are engaged in a collective enterprise as members of a “Church invisible” working together to achieve justice in history. As later Idealists moved away from Kant’s ideas about personal immortality, this idea of “historical immortality” took center stage. Through social projects that outlive us we maintain a kind of presence after death. Conceptions of historical immortality moved not just into the universalistic ideologies of liberalism and revolutionary socialism but into nationalist and racist doctrines that opposed them. But how, after global wars and genocide, can we retain faith in any conception of shared moral progress and, if not, what is to become of the idea of historical immortality?

			<title>[Today] Talk or similar: THE LOGICAL PROBLEM OF EVIL FROM A PARACONSISTENT PERSPECTIVE</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/110289</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Itala Maria Loffredo D'Ottaviano (University of Campinas)<br/>Itala Maria Loffredo D'Ottaviano (Universidade Estadual de Campinas)<br/><br/><p>Dear Colleague,<br/><br/>You are invited to participate in the next session of the Logic and Religion Webinar Series which will be held on <strong>April 13 (Thursday), 2023</strong>, at <strong>4pm CET</strong> with the topic:</p>
<p><strong>THE LOGICAL PROBLEM OF EVIL FROM A PARACONSISTENT PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Itala Maria Loffredo D'Ottaviano (University of Campinas, Brazil).<strong><br/>Chair:</strong> Evandro Gomes (State University of Maringá, Brazil).</p>
<p>Please, register in advance to access the zoom link:<br/>https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars</p>
<p> <br/>Abstract: After a brief discussion on the presence of <u>paraconsistent approaches in the history of Western thought</u>, in special in ancient and medieval times, we will characterize paraconsistent logic, created only during the 20th century. Recently, <u>Bertato (2021)</u> presented a proposal for a Formal Natural Theology through a first-order logical theory, by formally introducing fundamental concepts such as divine, necessary, and supreme. In this presentation, based on Bertato’s system, we will propose a paraconsistent underlying approach to deal with the Logical Problem of Evil, such that the presence of contradictions does not lead to logical triviality.</p>
<p>Join us 5 minutes prior to the beginning of the session!<br/> <br/>With best wishes,</p>
<p>-- </p>

Charles demanded that puritans change voting practices, baptismal policies, and laws, and he also cast an eye on local resources such as forests, a valuable source of masts for the English navy. In the face of this threat to local rule, colonists had to decide whether they would submit to the commissioners’ authority, which they viewed as arbitrary because it was not accountable to the people, or whether they would mobilize to defy the crown.</span></p><p><span>Those resisting the crown included not just freemen (voters) but also people often seen as excluded or marginalized such as non-freemen, indentured servants, and women. Together they crafted a potent regional constitutional culture in defiance of Charles II that was characterized by a skepticism of metropolitan ambition, a defense of civil and religious liberties, and a conviction that self-government was divinely sanctioned.</span></p><p><span>The event is free to all, but registration is required via this link: </span><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FXyxEovIRASqkdZXmkR5Mg" rel="nofollow"><span>https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FXyxEovIRASqkdZXmkR5Mg</span></a></p><p><span>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.</span></p><p><span>For more information, please email <a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org?subject=A%20Constitutional%20Culture">info@14beacon.org</a>.</span></p><p><br/><span><strong>SPEAKER BIO</strong></span></p><p><strong>Adrian Chastain Weimer</strong> is Professor of History at Providence College.

<p><strong>Early Career Workshop on Islamic Thought and Anglophone Philosophy – May 17-19</strong></p>
<p>New Deadline: <strong><u>April 24th, 2023</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The Princeton Project in Philosophy and Religion invites abstracts for an early career workshop in Islamic thought and Anglophone philosophy to be held from <strong><u>May 17-19</u></strong>.</p>
<p>The workshop seeks to foster research that places Islamic thought in conversation with Anglophone philosophy. Islamic thought is widely conceived to include classical philosophy (<em>falsafah</em>), post-classical philosophy (<em>ḥikmah</em>), philosophical theology (<em>kalām</em>), logic (<em>mantiq</em>), legal philosophy (<em>ʾuṣūl al-fiqh</em>), spiritual philosophy (<em>taṣawwuf</em>), rhetoric (<em>balaghaḥ</em>), and the philosophy of language (<em>lughah</em>). All areas of contemporary Anglophone philosophy will be considered and submissions in epistemology and philosophy of religion are especially encouraged.</p>
<p>We invite abstracts from many disciplines including Philosophy, Near Eastern and Islamic studies, Religion and Theology, and History that are intellectually rigorous and focus on theoretical analysis of philosophical arguments while remaining conscious of historical context.</p>
<p>Submissions are open to advanced graduate students (ABD or equivalent) and early career recent PhD recipients (within three years of receiving their PhD who have not secured a tenure-track position). Applicants should be able to demonstrate interdisciplinary knowledge and training appropriate to their research proposal.</p>
<p>Each successful applicant will be allocated two faculty respondents, one from Philosophy and one from Islamic studies, who will provide comments on their paper and serve as a commentator at the workshop. Andrew Chignell (Princeton), Lara Buchak (Princeton), and John Pittard (Yale) will be the faculty respondents from Philosophy. Frank Griffel (Yale) and two other faculty members will be the faculty respondents from Islamic thought and intellectual history.</p>

Danforth Center, Washington University in St. Louis</p><p>Dates: 30 May-1 June, 2023</p><p>What is the relationship between politics and religion, political commitment and religious commitment in the work of Simone Weil? To what extent does Weil’s theology influence her politics, and her politics influence her theology—and how might attention to this question change how we read Weil today? How does Weil separate questions of Church from questions of religion, and what can our answers to these questions tell us about connections between Church and State in the U.S.? This workshop will consider these and other questions about Simone Weil’s political theology and inquiries emerging from it.</p><p>This workshop will be held at the John C. Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University in St. Louis. In keeping with the Center’s focus on scholarly and public engagement with issues at the intersection of politics and religion in the United States, we invite reflection on Weil that considers her thought in dialogue with religious life in the U.S. While Weil kept her eyes largely on her native France, she spent the summer and early fall of 1942 in New York, where she conducted research at public libraries in order to “dig into the hidden recesses of theology.” Weil’s thought has been influential for leading U.S. public intellectuals, from Susan Sontag and Mary McCarthy to Christian Wiman, Christy Wampole, and others today.</p><p>The conference will convene at the John C. Danforth Center on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, where lodging will be available for participants. Additional travel grants will also be available.</p><p>We call for proposals of works in progress, more polished moments of ongoing inquiries, experimental projects, and other approaches to thinking together about the above questions and contexts.</p><p>Please send your 500-word abstracts on Weil and political theology to Fannie Bialek and Ben Davis by November 15, 2022. Emails: abialek[at]wustl.edu and benjamin.davis.1[at]slu.edu.</p></div></div></div></description>

			<title>[ March 31, 2023 -  April 1, 2023] Conference or similar: Philosophy of religion in Asia</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/103290</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The Veritas Research Center (at UIC, Yonsei University) is hosting a workshop on the philosophy of religion, which will be held in a hybrid format in Seoul/online on March 31 (Friday)/April 1 (Saturday) 2023.</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to diversify and globalize philosophy of religion. As it stands, philosophy of religion has traditionally tended to pay particular attention to philosophical questions arising within and about Christianity. Moreover, leading English philosophy of religion journals tend to receive far more submissions from English-speaking parts of the world. At the same time, philosophy of religion is a broad field that encompasses philosophically relevant questions arising within and about any religious tradition and about religion(s) in general. Relatedly, journals such as the <em>Journal of Analytic Theology</em>, <em>Religious Studies</em>, and the <em>International Journal for Philosophy of Religion</em> are seeking more submissions from non-English-speaking parts of the world. Thus, the field has much potential to continue its ongoing efforts to globalize and diversify.</p>
<p>In addition to talks on any topic of the philosophy of religion, the workshop will include a <strong>Publication Seminar</strong> held by Prof. Helen De Cruz, Executive Editor of the <em>Journal of Analytic Theology. </em>This seminar is aimed at early career researchers and doctoral students across Asia who are interested in publishing in leading English philosophy of religion journals. The seminar will offer practical advice on how to make a paper ready for submission (e.g., cover letter, formatting), where and how to submit, how to increase the odds that your paper survives the desk review stage, when to query an editor, etc.</p>
<p>We invite abstracts of between 150 and 300 words on any topic in philosophy of religion(s), broadly construed. We particularly encourage early career researchers working in Asia to apply.</p>
<p>Please send your abstract as an email attachment, with the subject line ‘Philosophy of Religion in Asia’ to <a href="mailto:nataljadeng@yonsei.ac.kr">nataljadeng at yonsei.ac.kr</a> by 23:59 (KST) on November 30 2022. Papers should be suitable for a 20-30 minute presentation. In the body of the email, please indicate (a) your current affiliation, and (b) whether you would prefer to present in person or online. (Please note that we cannot offer travel funding, so that you should only indicate that you prefer to present in person if you have travel funding or are based in Seoul or its surroundings.)</p>
<p>In case of questions, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:nataljadeng@yonsei.ac.kr">nataljadeng at yonsei.ac.kr</a></p>
<p>The event is jointly sponsored by Prof. <strong>Yujin Nagasawa</strong>’s Global Philosophy of Religion Project at the University of Birmingham (<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.global-philosophy.org/__;!!K543PA!OpbVpEmmnkasi-MEbQtSTI1olToT2CclUhFgqSHti4M3f_vpPjP-_WLmPgSEHQVeiF2I1NPlJ9DDCfsS%24">https://www.global-philosophy.org/</a>) and the Veritas Research Center, Underwood International College (UIC), Yonsei University.</p></description>

<p> </p>
<p>The Marilynne Robinson Society at the ALA is seeking papers that examine the author’s relationship to American evangelicalism.  Robinson’s spiritual vision has been shaped by the writings of Jonathan Edwards, who is considered to be the founding father of American evangelicalism.  How does Robinson’s body of work lead us to think critically about the evangelical tradition in the United States?  How do her essays and novels, particularly <em>Gilead</em>, provide a counter-narrative to the discourses found in modern and contemporary American evangelicalism?  In what ways can they respond to the incisive diagnosis presented by Kristen Du Mez’s recent book, <em>Jesus and John Wayne</em>, a text that examines the connection between American evangelicalism, Christian nationalism, rugged masculinity, and political power? How might Robinson’s novels and essays in conversation with Du Mez’s <em>Jesus and John Wayne</em> illuminate our understanding of the evangelical tradition in the United States?  These are some of the questions that the panel seeks to address.</p>
<p>The annual American Literature Association (ALA) conference will take place in Boston, MA, May 25-28, 2023.  </p>

			<title>[ November 30, 2022] CFP for conference or similar: 2023 Uehiro Graduate Philosophy Conference - What Dreams May Come?: Philosophical Explorations in Dreaming, Suffering, and Death</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/101438</link>
						<description><p>Call For Papers - Spring 2023 Uehiro Philosophy Graduate Student Conference</p>
<p>Title/Topic: What Dreams May Come?: Philosophical Explorations in Dreaming, Suffering, and Death</p>
<p>Date: Thursday, March 2nd &amp; Friday, March 3rd, 2023</p>
<p>Location: University of Hawaii-Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii</p>
<p>The University of Hawaii at Manoa Philosophy Department is calling for papers for its annual Uehiro Graduate Student Conference “What Dreams May Come?: Philosophical Explorations in Dreaming, Suffering, and Death”. We invite graduate students working in all areas of philosophy to submit papers on the conference theme. We welcome interdisciplinary submissions, and we strongly encourage submissions from members of underrepresented groups. The conference will take place in person. Travel costs will be subsidized for a small number of student presenters who submit full papers. Affordable lodging will be available for all presenters.</p>
<p>We are honored to have Dr. Michael Brady (University of Glasgow), Dr. Melanie Rosen (Trent University) and Dr. Arindam Chakrabarti (University of Hawaii-Manoa) as our keynote speakers.</p>
<p>This year’s conference title is inspired by the famous lines in Hamlet:</p>
<p>“To be, or not to be, that is the question:</p>
<p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,</p>
<p>And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep</p>
<p>No more; and by a sleep, to say we end</p>
<p>The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks</p>
<p>That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation</p>
<p>Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,</p>
<p>To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,</p>
<p>For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, </p>
<p>Must give us pause. ”</p>
<p>Papers should explore dreaming, suffering, and death, and grapple with questions that arise out of these facets of life. These topics may also be broadly construed. For example, we welcome papers on "dreaming" as both a phenomena in philosophy of mind and as an "ideal" or "aspiration" in other areas of philosophy. Likewise, "suffering" can include the philosophy of pain, or "duḥkha" in Buddhist philosophy. As such, we invite papers from all philosophical fields and traditions.</p>
<p>Presentations should not exceed twenty (20) minutes in length, and another five (5) minutes for questions. Paper submissions should not exceed 4000 words. Abstracts are also welcome and should not exceed 250 words, but preference for travel funds will be given to completed papers. Submissions should be prepared for blind review. The deadline for submissions is November 30, 2022, and presenters will be notified of our decision by early January.</p>
<p>Send papers as a PDF file and prepared for blind review to uehriogradpc@gmail.com - In the body of the e-mail please include: 1) Your name, 2) Title of the paper, 3) Institutional affiliation, 4) Contact information (e-mail, phone, or mailing address)</p>
<p>The conference is free and open to the public.</p></description>

Our central question is whether or not, and to what extent, Catholicism inspired abolitionist ideas and movements in the Atlantic world during the early modern era. We use “abolitionisms” in the plural to include instances that may not be connected because of their chronological or geographical distance and to suggest a comparative dimension. We think that a variety of actors (clergymen, indigenous populations, enslaved Africans and Afro-Creoles, members of the Roman Curia, intellectuals in Europe and the Americas, both in colonial times and after independence) may have resorted to Catholic ideas as an argument to criticize the slave trade and colonial slavery fundamentally; and to Catholic networks to concretely reform and possibly abolish the slave trade. </span></span></div><div><span> </span></div><div><span><span>Topics for the conference include (but are not limited to):</span></span></div><ol><li><span><span>The attitude and actions of specific groups of clergy (notably religious orders) to the question of slavery and slave trade, for example, how the Dominicans with Las Casas (16th c.), or the Capuchins with De Jaca and Moirans (17th c.) substantially contested slavery and the slave trade.</span></span></li><li><span><span>The attitude and ensuing actions taken by the Roman Curia based on reports and requests coming from missionaries across the world, both before and after officially condemning slavery in 1839 (for example, the 11 articles issued in 1686 on the enslavement of Africans; or the ad-hoc deliberations on specific “cases of conscience” submitted by missionaries from the Americas).</span></span></li><li><span><span>Catholic-inspired movements of protest and rebellion by indigenous people in the Americas, for example, the rebellion led by the messianic leader Juan Santos Atahualpa in Peru (second half of the 18th c.).</span></span></li><li><span><span>Catholic-inspired movements of protest and rebellion by enslaved Africans and Afro-Creoles in the Americas and West and Central Africa, for example, the messianic and reform Catholicism movement led by the Beatriz Kimpa Vita in the Kingdom of Kongo (early 18th c. ).</span></span></li><li><span><span>Catholic-inspired intellectual circles and networks in Europe and the Americas in the age of abolition, for example, the Abbé Gregoire’s political action and treatises during the French Revolution.</span></span></li><li><span><span>The influence of Catholic-inspired arguments against slavery on intellectuals and politicians who acted in a secular sphere or were personally Protestant, for example, Brissot’s abolitionism.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Trans-confessional networks that debated abolitionism with religious arguments, for example, King Christophe of Haiti and the English abolitionist Thomas Clarkson</span></span></li></ol><div><span><span>Please note that we do not have a precise overview of the funding available at this stage.

</p><p>Comparative Political Theory Conference</p>
<p>Title: “The Art of Ruling: Ancient Conceptions of Leadership in a Global Context”</p>
<p>Date: December 3, 2022</p>
<p>Location: New York University, Liberal Studies (726 Broadway, 6th Floor)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The conference invites submissions on ancient conceptions of political leadership. It intends to be global in scope, bringing together perspectives that emerged in multiple ancient civilizations. Examples of such civilizations include the Babylonian, Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Judean, Indian, Mayan, Nubian, Persian, and Roman civilizations. How did thinkers in ancient times understand the qualities of a good leader? How did they conceptualize the relationship between rulers and ruled? What challenges did they think leadership entails? From what lived experiences did their conceptions emerge? Did a conception of leaderless politics appear anywhere in the ancient world? How do ancient conceptions of leadership differ from those of the modern era? And how might ancient conceptions of leadership continue to inform our views of leadership today? We invite direct commentaries on the works of ancient thinkers (e.g., Confucius, Plato) as well as papers on later thinkers who interpreted the ancients (e.g., Arendt, Foucault). While the conference relates to a central theme in political theory, we welcome papers that explore ancient conceptions of leadership from multiple disciplinary standpoints (e.g., history, biography, literature, mythology).</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>
<p>The conference will take place in person. Presentations should be no longer than twenty-five minutes in length.  </p>
<p><strong>Abstracts:</strong></p>
<p>Please submit a two hundred fifty word abstract for papers here <a href="https://www.cptls.org/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cptls.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1663684409698000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zzYvkyETcpOxpI-1w5meq">https://www.cptls.org</a>   </p>

<p>edited by Sérgio Dias Branco (University of Coimbra)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Special Issue, entitled “Religion and the Working Class in Film”, aims to combine the latest developments in the study of religion and film with new approaches in working-class studies. Recently, research within the study of religion and film has produced more concrete studies regarding precise topics and works. At the same time, new working-class studies have given special importance to the cultural expressions that emerge from working-class people and evoke their complex, multifaceted, and intersectional experiences. The main purpose of this Special Issue is to publish contributions that investigate the links between religion and the working class in film grounded in these current discussions.</p>
<p>Scholarship on religion and film—from philosophical, theological, and cultural perspectives—has increased in quantity and quality in recent years. Publications by Inge Kirsner (Komm und sieh: Religion im Film, 2020), Stefanie Knauss (Religion and Film: Representation, Experience, Meaning, 2020), S. Brent Plate (Religion and Film: Cinema and the Re-Creation of the World, 2nd ed., 2017), as well as those by M. Gail Hamner, Terry Lindvall, Gerard Loughlin, John C. Lyden, Joel W. Martin, and Melanie Wright, among others, have promoted and advanced discussions regarding the complex relations between film and religion. Additionally, some researchers have concentrated on specific religious traditions—e.g., Nathan Abrams (The New Jew in Film: Exploring Jewishness and Judaism in Contemporary Cinema, 2012), Francisca Cho (“Imagining Nothing and Imaging Otherness in Buddhist Film”, 1999), Christopher Deacy (Screen Christologies: Redemption and the Medium of Film, 2002), and Kristian Petersen (edited, New Approaches to Islam in Film, 2021)—and others have focused on filmmakers—e.g., Christopher B. Barnett and Clark J. Elliston (edited, Theology and the Films of Terrence Malick, 2018) or Joel Mayward (The Dardenne Brothers’ Cinematic Parables: Integrating Theology, 2022). This effort to limit the scope of research within the study of religion and film has produced more concrete studies regarding precise topics and works.</p>
<p>A topic that may be fruitfully paired with religion in the study of film is the representation of the working class. Recently, researchers such as John Russo and Sherry Lee Linkon (edited, New Working-Class Studies, 2005) have identified and sought to define new trends in working-class studies. A feature of these tendencies is the way they place the working class at the center of inquiry, rather than as a subsequent topic that surfaces from research into social and economic history. The working class works differently in the workplace, in the household, and in communities, and it is shaped by race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and place, but also religion. These new studies have given special importance to the cultural expressions that emerge from working-class people and evoke their experiences.</p>
<p>This Special Issue seeks research that considers the developments in the study of religion and film and the new methodological approaches in the working-class studies outlined above. Authors should investigate the links between religion and the working class in film grounded in these current discussions.</p>
<p>Research topics may include (but are not limited to) the following, articulated with specific or comparative analyses of films, individually or in a group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Religion and labor activism;</li>
<li>Religion and the migration and displacement of workers;</li>
<li>Religion and colonialism;</li>
<li>Religion and working-class environments and backgrounds;</li>
<li>Class conflicts in religious settings and contexts;</li>
<li>Cooperation and antagonism between working-class people from different religions;</li>
<li>Cultural politics of the working class as shaped by religion;</li>
<li>Labor unions and progressive politics linked with religious doctrine and organizations;</li>
<li>Intersectional readings that relate religion and class with race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and place;</li>
<li>Religions and their connections with disadvantaged social strata.</li>
</ul>

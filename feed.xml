			<title>[ June 14, 2023] Conference or similar: Hyperdigital Designs</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/111009</link>
						<description>Venue: Alison Richards Building, 7 West Road (Sidgwick Site)<br/><br/><p>Digital technologies have become a deeply integrated aspect of our lives. From speaking to friends and ordering food to finding our way around, all our daily acts are now mediated by the digital. This deep integration promises to expand our agency, yet it also shapes and constrains it in ways that we may not recognise or welcome. Increasingly, we are confronted with a dilemma: either to withdraw from or engage with the use of digital technologies, as these often tend to disperse our attention and hinder our self-awareness. In the space of possibilities between anti-technological suspicions and anti-human desires for assimilation, we aim to critically reflect on the creative origins and free use of the cybernetic grammar of digital computers.</p>
<p>The ‘Hyperdigital Designs’ workshop at the University of Cambridge will explore creative reflections upon the grammar of digital computers. Building upon the collaborative ‘How to Play with Fire’ project that began at the 2022 Diverse Intelligence Summer Institute, the ‘Hyperdigital’ announces a higher reflection on the creation and use of digital media for human freedom. Beyond the fixed opposition between the Postdigital and the Digital, the Hyperdigital exceeds so as more radically to enter and accelerate the free use of the digital — whether among the creators of digital systems, or from the oldest creator of the idea of the digital itself.</p>
<p>We invite abstracts of up to 250 words for a one-day workshop on Wednesday 14 June 2023 at the University of Cambridge, Alison Richards Building SG2, hosted by Cambridge Digital Humanities and co-sponsored by the William Temple Foundation, to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on thinking beyond the digital at its highest point. We are interested to host talks that explore the fundamental theoretical questions of philosophy, theology, ethics, and art, as well as applied and practical discussions concerning how technologies or designs, from video games to generative artificial intelligence, can be envisioned to mediate and emancipate human creativity.</p>
<p>Send abstracts 250 words or less to HyperdigitalDesigns@gmail.com</p>
<p>Deadline for abstracts: Saturday 13 May 2023</p>
<p>Notice: Monday 15 May 2023</p>

						<description>Publication Name: Essay Prize: Is Consciousness Fundamental?<br/><br/><p>Essay Prize: Is Consciousness Fundamental?</p>
<p>Submissions are welcome for an essay prize on the question of whether consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe that is part of the John Templeton Foundation funded project, “Panpsychism and Pan(en)theism: Philosophy of Mind Meets Philosophy of Relligion,” led by Philip Goff (Durham University) and Andrei A.

Tracing but also challenging such a narrative of technological change and obsolescence, this workshop investigates the possibilities and limitations of transparency in all its material instantiations, and from perspectives both transhistorical and theoretical. Case studies include gauze, celluloid, varnish, openwork caskets, optical lenses, polaroid film, mordants, and witch balls. Taking these examples as starting points for wide-ranging discussion, we will think together about how the physical properties of a clear substrate, glaze, or surface might prompt reflection on concepts such as in/visibility, opacity, transcendency, distortion, obstinancy (<em>Eigensinn</em>), racialization, disclosure, and access.</p><p>Scheduled to coincide with the release of two important new books on transparency, <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/V/bo183106455.html" rel="nofollow"><em>The Varnish and the Glaze: Painting Splendor with Oil, 1100-1500</em></a> (Chicago, 2023), by Marjolijn Bol, and <em><a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300237245/transparency/" rel="nofollow">Transparency: The Material History of an Idea</a></em> (Yale, 2023), by Daniel Jütte, this workshop engages with current scholarship in the history of art, science, architecture, religion, museology, and conservation. </p><p>Supported by eikones, the NOMIS Foundation, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.</p><p>-------</p><p>Program<strong> </strong></p><p>Location: Forum eikones, Rheinsprung 11, 4051 Basel</p><p>From 08:30 - Welcome - coffee in the foyer</p><p>09:00 - Ruth Ezra, Introduction</p><p>09:20 - Patrick Crowley, ‘The Wrong Side of Things’: Roman Reverse-Engraved Glass</p><p>10:00 - Manuela Beer, Difference in Transparency: Rock Crystal in Medieval Artefacts</p><p>10:40 - Coffee break</p><p>11:00 - Arne Leopold, Veiling the Gaze, Veiling the Material: Openwork Caskets and the Pretence of Transparency in the 13th Century</p><p>11:40 - Leena Crasemann, Veiling Space: Textiles’ Anti-matter</p><p>12:20 - Lunch break</p><p>13:20 - Elizabeth Rice Mattison, Acid, Water, Rust, and Process in Dürer’s Etchings</p><p>14:00 - Phillip Roberts, Richard Reeve and Alice Grove: A Night Language</p><p>14:40 - Coffee break</p><p>15:00 - Jennifer Y.

Recovering from the long shadow of decline theories and narratives, the ongoing study of Muslim intellectual pursuits in the subcontinent is bringing to light a world far more dynamic than previously believed. The region appears better situated within transregional contexts, while offering unique intellectual trajectories with reverberations across a broader range of fields. This conference invites specialists to present research on Muslim intellectual history in Mughal South Asia within the following areas:</h5><ol><li><h5>Philosophy, Theology, and Science</h5></li><li><h5>Rhetoric, Law, and Scripturalist Disciplines</h5></li><li><h5>Islamo-Sanskrit Engagements</h5></li><li><h5>Socio-Intellectual History</h5></li></ol><h5>Despite great strides in the study of the social, political, and cultural institutions of early modern South Asia, these efforts are yet to be reconciled with parallel developments in the study of knowledge production across Persianate frontiers.  Meanwhile within history of ideas, we are only gradually overcoming the trappings of conventional accounts of intellectual life in the region, specifically the sweeping theses of intellectual marginality and decline grounded in dichotomies like canon vs. commentary, rationalism vs. mysticism/scripturalism, Arabic orthodoxy vs. Persian/Indian cosmopolitanism, and their projection onto the source material at face value, i.e., as exhaustive binaries that tend to obfuscate actual disciplinary frameworks, literary practice, and transmission of knowledge.  While there is growing consensus that the postclassical intellectual currents were longer lasting and more intricate than previously believed, the variegated details of this past pose new methodological challenges.</h5><h5>The conference invites current research on Muslim intellectual history in Mughal South Asia across areas like philosophy, theology, astronomy, rhetoric, jurisprudence, hadīth, tafsīr, Perso-Sanskrit interactions, infrastructures of knowledge production. The event will be hosted at U.C. Berkeley on October 6-7, 2023, with travel and accommodation covered for visiting participants.  Abstracts must be received by June 23.  Selected applicants will be notified by July 7.  Each participant will have 45 minutes to present (including Q&amp;A).  The final articles will be published as a special issue or volume edited by the organizers.  The submission deadline for articles is March 15, 2024.</h5><ul><li><h5>The conference will be held on <b>October 6-7, 2023 </b>at the University of California, Berkeley.</h5></li><li><h5>Abstracts of 300-400 words must be sent to <b><a href="mailto:ali_syed@berkeley.edu">ali_syed@berkeley.edu</a></b> no later than <b>June 23, 2023</b>.</h5></li><li><h5>The deadline for complete articles is <b>March 15, 2024</b>.</h5></li><li><h5>Expenses for travel and accommodation will be covered for visiting participants.</h5></li></ul><h5>The event is sponsored by Berkeley's Center for Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures (CMES) and the Institute of South Asia Studies (ISAS)</h5><address> </address><address> </address></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Asad Q.

The immediate aftermath of the war and the Holocaust across the Atlantic gave rise to tectonic global changes. Some intellectuals questioned the future of humanity. Others called for a new humanism, for a “common cause” and the constitution of “one world” greater and more inclusive than the failed European tradition of nationalism. The publicly emerging details of the Holocaust added to the sense of profound rupture later expressed in Theodor Adorno’s famous epithet about the end of poetry after Auschwitz or Jean-Francois Lyotard’s declaration that Auschwitz is like an earthquake that destroyed the measuring instruments. Indeed, scholars often speak of <i>post</i>-Holocaust philosophy and theology, marking it as an event from which there is a clear separation of before and after. The goal of our workshop, however, is not to revisit the long trajectory of post-Holocaust thought, but to reconstruct overlooked continuities and sense of rupture in the Jewish (and general) intellectual atmosphere during the immediate aftermath—that is about the first decade—following 1945.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>The profound changes were not limited to the European scene. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the war also in the Pacific, while raising urgent questions about the meaning of technology and the possibility of the human to initiate global destruction. The Cold War brought with it a world under the sway of two superpowers. At the same time, the emergence of the United Nations as a world-organization allowed thinkers to imagine new world-constellations and helped give rise to the discourse of human rights. In the Jewish context, the founding of the State of Israel in 1948 brought with it a promise and many challenges.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>What kind of philosophies, or theologies, informed the immediate postwar constellation? How were past and present interpreted by historians or political thinkers? What futures were envisioned and a time of radical change? How was the turning point of 1945 theorized through the perspectives of flight and refuge?</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Our workshop will bring together scholars to think about 1945 and its immediate aftermath through a transnational lens of the Jewish experience. Its focus will be on voices—philosophical, theological, theoretical, or personal—reflecting on the Jewish condition at the end of the war and the beginning of a new era. This approach allows us to explore the interchange of ideas across multiple spaces and travel itineraries. We contend that such a perspective, which in this form has rarely been emphasized in the study of modern Jewish thought, can offer more complexity and nuance to the idea of a <i>Stunde null</i> in Jewish philosophy and theology by showing the extent to which thinkers navigated multiple international contexts before, during, and after the Holocaust and World War II. The focus on an epochal “watershed” also allows us to reflect more broadly on how intellectuals have grappled with historical discontinuities, turning points, and ideas of return and restoration.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><b><span>Some of the questions this workshop will ask: </span></b></span></span></span></p><ol><li><span><span><span><span>What kind of intellectual networks—Jewish and non-Jewish—developed in the immediate postwar era?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>What continuities exist between pre- and post-Holocaust thought?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>How was the atomic bomb theorized by Jewish and non-Jewish thinkers across continents?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>How did the emergent Cold War context shape Jewish thought? </span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Are there new historiographies that emerge in this period as a result of the World War and the Holocaust?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>In what way do itineraries of Jewish thinkers change the way we think about Jewish thought as often focused on the nation-state or linguistic commonality (such as German-Jewish thought)?</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>What accounts for the emerging interest in the post-1945 era today?</span></span></span></span></li></ol><p><span><span><span><b><span>Some of the figures of Jewish background we might discuss: </span></b></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>Hannah Arendt, Raymond Aron, Leo Baeck, Eliezer Berkovitz, Ernst Bloch, Martin Buber, Ernst Cassirer, Arthur Cohen, Lucy Dawidowicz, Isaac Deutscher, Emil Fackenheim, Erich Fromm, Nahum Glatzer, Abraham J.

<p>Theme: After Disaster</p>
<p>Charleston Southern University Charleston, SC</p>
<p>October 26-28, 2023</p>
<p>Keynote Speaker: Dr. Susan Felch, Professor Emerita, Calvin University</p>
<p>My [kitchen, syllabus] is a disaster. [Higher ed, the planet] faces impending disaster. [The responsible party of your choice] bungled the disaster response. We frequently invoke the word “disaster” to convey a sense of magnitude but also to imply events beyond our control. Questions of agency lie embedded in the word’s etymology—maybe it’s the stars’ fault—and yet we seem to believe that human response is possible and perhaps even imperative. Among the many possible responses to various disasters over the millennia, the literary offers the opportunity to slow down, to examine what has happened and what may be salvaged—and to develop and practice Christian virtues.</p>
<p>Conference participants will ponder these themes with keynote speaker Dr. Susan Felch (Renaissance and Reformation scholar and co-author of Teaching and the Christian Imagination). We invite papers that consider literary responses to disasters past, present, and future (the “after” in the conference title is mostly there for assonance). Possible topics include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>•            Lament and other biblical genres depicting and responding to disaster</p>
<p>•            Plague, famine, and fire in literature</p>
<p>•            Cli-fi (climate fiction)</p>
<p>•            Ethical and aesthetic limitations of depicting disaster, whether personal or public</p>
<p>•            Interpreting and/or memorializing disaster in its aftermath</p>
<p>•            Theodicy and other theological responses to disaster</p>
<p>•            Agency in disaster prevention, experience, or response</p>
<p>Other proposals concerning the relationship of Christianity and literature, including panel proposals and creative works, are welcome. Presenters should be members of the Conference on Christianity and Literature by the time of the conference.</p>
<p>Submit abstracts of 250-300 words by August 1, 2023, to Dr. Carissa Turner Smith, <a href="mailto:csmith@csuniv.edu" target="_blank">csmith@csuniv.edu</a>. Undergraduate students must submit their entire paper for consideration; eligible undergraduate papers will be entered into the national CCL Undergraduate Writing Contest for a cash prize. Graduate students accepted to the conference are encouraged to apply for the CCL Conference Travel Grant.</p>
<p>Schedule information: Participants who arrive early on October 26 are welcome to attend an afternoon pedagogy workshop led by Dr. Felch and to explore Charleston sites in the evening. Conference panels will run in the morning and afternoon on October 27 and 28. Dr. Felch’s keynote address will be in the late afternoon on October 27, followed by a dinner at which the Conference on Christianity and Literature’s 2022 <a href="https://www.christianityandliterature.com/" target="_blank">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> will be presented to Dr. Jewel Spears Brooker, T. S. Eliot scholar and Professor Emerita of Literature at Eckerd College.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS: ABSTRACTS DUE JUNE 15, 2023</strong></p>
<p>As we watch the new silhouette of Notre Dame rising from the burned ruins of its past, participate in vigorous debates about how the study of the Middle Ages will be pursued now and in the future, and plan to meet on a campus where medieval buildings have literally been rebuilt, we invite proposals for individual papers, whole sessions, or round tables on the conference theme of “construction and (re)construction.” Papers might consider the notions of</p>
<ul>
<li>How identities and places have been constructed in various periods of medieval history, literature, politics, art, and culture;</li>
<li>The ways in which medieval systems of belief, value, and thought have been constructed, deconstructed, appropriated, and/or reconstructed;</li>
<li>The relationships between form and construction (whether they be verse, literary, political, musical, architectural, artistic, ideologic, etc.);</li>
<li>Ways in which modern society, countries, organizations, and/or individuals have re-made the medieval in their modern images;</li>
<li>The ongoing debates about how we conceptualize, pursue, and further the study of the Middle Ages in the 21st century.</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstracts on any aspect of medieval studies are welcome, but we will give preference to submissions related to the conference theme.</p>
<p>The organizers are extremely proud that Rock Hill was home to one of the earliest of the “sit-in” lunch counter protests that sparked the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s. The conference will be held only a few blocks where the Friendship Nine were arrested for their lunch counter sit-in in February 1960, and a short drive from the tribal lands of the Catawba Indian Nation. In respect of these important historical and cultural contexts, we particularly invite papers and panels that focus on the ways in which diverse and/or indigenous religious, social, physical, political, legal, and/or economic identities have been constructed and reconstructed in the Middle Ages and beyond.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposals for individual papers should be limited to 300 words.</li>
<li>Session proposals or roundtables should include an overview and abstracts for the three papers for a session, or 5-6 abstracts for a roundtable, as well as the contact information for all presenters.</li>
<li>When considering sending an abstract, applicants should be aware that SEMA 2023 will be a fully in-person conference with no options for remote presentation and attendance.</li>
<li><strong>On your submission, please indicate any Audio/Visual needs!!!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Please submit proposals using the forms at <a href="https://semarockhill2023.com/">https://semarockhill2023.com/</a> no later than <strong>June 15, 2023</strong>. If you have questions, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:sema2023@winthrop.edu">sema2023@winthrop.edu</a>. </p>

<p>Presiding Officer/Panel Chair: Maria Mothes (University of Koblenz, Germany)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The panel invites papers discussing texts that shape the perception and representation of Muslimness and/or Islam in contemporary literature. Global, transnational, and comparative perspectives are welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>This panel seeks to contextualize the current position of Muslims in Western societies as either marginalized or made hypervisible. More often than not, portrayals of Muslims in the media or popular culture focus on the adherents of the imagined category of ‘Islam,’ rendering the people behind this category invisible. In light of the all-to-common binary distinctions (secular/religious, moderns/traditional, etc.), this panel seeks to contemplate ways toward “a religious literacy that does not overdetermine the role of religion” (Rashid 61). Instead of the either/or trap, an epistemological approach allowing us to trace ‘both/and’ is sought out “since the most common Muslim life is lived amidst a congeries of various laws and norms” (Reinhart 8). The panel seeks to create a space for dialogue about how contemporary literature negotiates holistic but also nuanced identities and how Muslimness is depicted as part of the spectrum of the human experience. Moreover, the panel invites papers investigating the role of literature in shaping the perception and representation of religion and how literature thus contributes to shifting perspectives on Islam and Muslimness.</p>
<p>Please submit abstract proposals using the PAMLA online submission form (you will have to go to <a href="https://pamla.ballastacademic.com/">https://pamla.ballastacademic.com</a> to login or create an account first). Please note: PAMLA is an entirely in-person conference.</p>

			<title>[ July 15, 2024 -  July 16, 2024] Conference or similar: Ultimate Reality / Divinity as the Ground: Exploring the Structure of Reality across Eastern and Western Traditions</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/119350</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>In recent analytic scholarship, a significant portion of the research concerning 'because'-statements has revolved around discussions about metaphysical grounding. Theories of grounding, primarily delving into relations of metaphysical dependence, offer valuable insights into conceptualizing Ultimate Reality / Divinity. Rather than viewing the Divine / Ultimately Real as an individual being alongside, and as the cause of other beings, Ground-of-being theories propose understanding it as the foundation on which every being metaphysically depends. The notion of ground, along with its associated metaphysical explanatory aspect, has long been an integral component of cosmological reasoning in East and West. Although the idea of Divinity / Ultimate Reality as the ground is present in Mystical threads of Abrahamic traditions, it finds substantial sway in Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, and Zoroastrianism. Entire schools of thought and practices have emerged from disputes surrounding the fundamental structure of reality in these traditions: The ground of beings has been conceived as necessary or contingent, foundational or infinite, definite or indefinite, effable or ineffable, and consistent or inconsistent. Thus, Ground-of-being models of reality can significantly contribute to fostering mutual discussions within the scopes of both Metaphysics and analytic Philosophy of Religion.</p>
<p><br/>Consequently, we aim to gather scholars in Metaphysics and Philosophy of Religion to promote a fruitful dialogue regarding the structure of reality among Eastern and Western traditions. We enthusiastically welcome interdisciplinary approaches and encourage engaging in discussions that extend beyond the traditional boundaries of philosophical inquiry. The invited speakers are as follows:</p>
<p>·       Graham Priest - CUNY Graduate Centre (Buddhism)</p>
<p>·       Daniel Nolan - University of Notre Dame (Zoroastrianism)</p>
<p>·       Jessica Frazier - University of Oxford (Hinduism)</p>
<p>·       Mohammad Saleh Zarepour - University of Manchester (Islam)</p>
<p>·       Joshua Sijuwade - London School of Theology (Christianity)</p>
<p>·       Zishan Khawaja - University of Liverpool (Buddhism)</p>
<p>Four additional slots are reserved for submitted papers, with a special focus on Daoism and Mystical traditions. We invite abstracts of up to 500 words. Papers should be suitable for a 30-minute presentation (followed by 15 minutes of discussion). We hope to have some funds for supporting postgraduate students. If you are interested in presenting, please send your abstract to Mohsen Moghri (m.moghri@bham.ac.uk) by Monday, April 1.</p>
<p>We plan to begin the workshop around lunchtime on July 15 to allow time for people to travel to Birmingham. The conference is in person and open to all, but please contact the organizer for registration and further information.</p></description>

			<title>[ June 17, 2024 -  June 19, 2024] Conference or similar: Between Past and Future: Existence, Embodiment, and Historicity</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/119166</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway </p>
<p>June 17–19, 2024</p>
<p>Confirmed keynote speakers: Charlotta Weigelt (Södertörn University), Jan Slaby (Freie Universität Berlin), Thomas Schwarz Wentzer (Aarhus University), Lisa Guenther (Queen’s University Canada) </p>
<p>Humans are historical beings. We live through, and interpret ourselves in the light of, our differing traditions, even when we are not aware of this fact. We may experience such traditions as traditions of power, domination, and suppression, but also as sources of inspiration and potential liberation from the present. At the same time all of us “have” our own history: we are born, we grow older, and eventually we die, and who we were at one time, as individuals and as parts of a community, affect what we are and are capable of becoming. Our past is, it may therefore be argued, ambiguous, and our future may depend on the way we appropriate and question our past. </p>
<p>We also tend to deny the historicity of our existence, a tendency that may come to expression in a variety of ways. We may attempt to break radically with the past, to “move on,” and to regard past traditions merely as objects of theoretical inquiry with at most an antiquarian relevance for contemporary society and life. And we may try to hide from the biological fact that human beings age and change, be that through pursuing “eternal youth” or by tacitly denying the right of older generations to take part in discussions of contemporary problems on a par with younger generations. In short, we tend to concentrate on the present while disregarding our past and its significance for the future.  </p>
<p>We hereby invite abstracts for papers in phenomenology and related areas of philosophy, such as critical theory, feminist philosophy, queer theory, and the post-Kantian tradition widely conceived. This year we especially encourage work that addresses the way historicity affects our existence, as embodied individuals and as communities. Questions to be addressed include, but are not limited to, the following: What can past traditions teach us when it comes to addressing contemporary problems such as the ecological crisis or the apparent decline in democratic sentiments? Are categories from past traditions a help or a hindrance for coming to grips with such problems? How is fruitful dialogue between differing traditions and cultures possible and how does cultural appropriation differ from genuine dialogue? How do traditions in science influence our conceptions of rationality? Can traditions within art, religion, and other cultural spheres help us reach a more comprehensive understanding of human rationality? How should we understand the connection between past traditions and radical new beginnings or truth-disclosing experiences, for instance in art?  </p></description>

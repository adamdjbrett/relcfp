This conference aims to discuss the interplay and adaptation strategies in, and between, the realms of religion and technology in an age of tremendous transformations. Among the transformations, we particularly wish to emphasize the rapid developments with regard to the digital world and the climate, and the considerable global changes and challenges they have produced. We think of ‘religion’ in this context as a key source for value-based solutions, and of ‘technology’ as a specific approach to the world. We regard religion and technology as mirror image twins and thus envisage projects on the changing forms of impacts through both of them.</div><div> </div><div>Recent trends in religious studies have emphasized “material religion” - with focus on the material elements of practice rather than just on theological or doctrinal matters. This turn opens up the way for the history of technology productively to intervene in a number of ways. Historians can illuminate the way objects exist in public performances of religious identity and belonging, and the changes in religion and religious practices, riding on technological advances (like online darshans/meditations, social-media channels, online groups, ‘Apps’, etc.). Beyond organized mainstream religions, papers can also look at the interface of technology and the ‘magical’ (acts, spirit possession, black magic), and other so-called 'demonic' work. Others may put the spotlight on the architecture of religious structures, the spiritual character of engineering works, the changing light, sound and other aesthetic elements, and how these changes reshape public participation both in terms of religion and technological usage and challenges. Ethical challenges like loss of privacy, anxiety about the human person’s distinctiveness and dignity, and mankind’s handling of the environment need to be discussed too with regard to increasing digitization and climate change. With the above broad lineaments, proposals can relate themselves to any of the following specific themes:</div><div> </div><div><em>1. Religion and the Digital World</em> – the Digital as a method to capture and describe the world and our livelihoods; vast increase around the world in the use of telecommunication and digital technologies for promotion of both traditional and new-age faiths – their increased valency especially amidst the Covid-19-induced restrictions on physical gatherings; ways in which pilgrimages have been transformed due to the new digital facilities (from travel planning to booking darshans); theological/philosophical re-orientations and reflections centered on these new openings.</div><div> </div><div><em>2. Technology and Religion in the Context of Climate Change</em> – possible solutions to the challenge of climate change from religion/theology; their distinctiveness from secular thought/debates; how climate change has impacted on the self-understanding of religions, their dogmatic, social and moral positions; the climate discourse as a modern form of apocalypticism; practical manifestation of ecological sensitivity - influencing the building of mosques, churches, and temples; influence of local communities and indigenous knowledge systems.</div><div> </div><div><em>3. Artificial Intelligence</em> – philosophical and spiritual/theological reflections touching on fundamental questions of Being, Consciousness and the (Post)human; parallelism in the ‘transcendence’ sought to be attained by spiritual efforts/exercises and those wrought by new spatial categories like ‘metaverse’ (going beyond our understandings of the ‘cyberworld’), and other such ontological questions and dilemmas.</div><div> </div><div><em>4. Technology and Religious scholarship/pedagogy</em> – from printing press to online theology classes; role of technology in preservation of religious materials and creation of religious repositories like digitisation of palm leaf manuscripts, building devotional hymns database; the regional variations in approach and content; the various innovative practices in creation, delivery and marketing; the subjectivity of technology and its power to include and exclude.</div><div> </div><div><em>5. Representation of Religious-Technological life worlds</em> – in literature, arts and films including science fiction/ climate fiction; representations of knowledge in policies and practices affecting the lives on the ground.</div><div> </div><div>In terms of methodology, it is hoped that the various proposals and papers would throw forth a rich mix of different approaches and source materials - including intercultural theology, oral history, decolonizing research methodologies, archival work, textual and media analysis, ethnographic research, social analysis, theoretical formulations and ethical/philosophical reflections.</div><div> </div><div>To submit a paper proposal, please send the following information on a single-sided document in English, before <strong>23 May 2023</strong> to <a href="mailto:ratirdacc23@gmail.com"><strong>ratirdacc23@gmail.com</strong></a>.</div><div><ul><li>A provisional Title and the Theme Number it would fit under (nos. 1 to 5 – see above)</li><li>Full name and academic post/institutional affiliation of the author/s</li><li>Full postal and email-addresses</li><li>An outline of about 400 words, highlighting the relevance of the paper to the conference themes, or other forms of interaction between technology and religion, and the main contribution/argument of the proposed paper</li><li>5-10 keys words</li></ul><div>Information about the acceptance of a paper will be given by end of May 2023 together with guidelines for the paper and its presentation and the Registration fee payment mode.

Mark Koyama</strong> grew up in South East Asia and New Zealand before coming to live in the United States in 1980. He was educated at Bates College, Union Theological Seminary (MA 1992), University of Massachusetts Amherst (MFA 2010) and Yale Divinity School (MDiv 2015).

Her doctorate from Brown University (1988) empowered her to serve infants and young children with vision loss, blindness and additional health and developmental challenges. Called by Christ to Antiracism work, Harriet is a powerful voice in the United Church of Christ where she has served on the Board of Directors of the National United Church of Christ and as Co-Chair of the Racial Justice Mission Group of the New Hampshire Conference. Harriet is a talented and inspired quilter. This comes naturally to her. She grew up making meals, clothing, rag rugs, and quilts out of scraps and leftovers.</span></p><p><span><strong>Kathy Barrett Blair</strong> is a lifelong resident of Keene, New Hampshire. With a degree in Occupational Therapy from UNH, she was the preschool occupational therapist for the Keene School District for 34 years. She chaired the NHCUCC Ukama Mission Group in partnership with UCC churches in Zimbabwe. Kathy designed and coordinated the renovation of UCC Keene’s Elsie Priest Park and children’s playground. She learned to sew in 4-H and continues to express her creativity through fabric, including the design and construction of Quilt #4 of the George Floyd Quilts. Kathy is honored to serve with Rev. Mark Koyama and Dr. Harriet Ward as coordinators of SAQM.</span></p><p><span>Join us for a thoughtful conversation with Mark, Harriet, and Kathy to learn more about how the project came into being, the important work it has done, and where the project is going. Registration for this event will also include time to view the quilts before and after the discussion.</span></p><p><span>The event is free to all, but tickets are extremely limited and <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-conversation-with-the-sacred-allies-tickets-631140447067" rel="nofollow">registration is required via Eventbrite</a>.</span></p><p><span>For more information, please email <a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org?subject=Sacred%20Allies%20Conversation">info@14beacon.org</a> or call 617.523.0470 ext. 223.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>This conversation is a component of the <em>Textile &amp; Text</em> exhibition that will be open to the public at the Congregational Library &amp; Archives June 19-21, 2023.

Together, these exhibitions demonstrate a shared thread of resistance and activism that can be traced through centuries of Congregational and American history.</p><p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/textile-text-sacred-ally-quilt-ministry-at-the-congregational-library-tickets-629239059967" rel="nofollow">Tickets are available for entry on the hour during the exhibition's opening hours on June 19th, 20th, and 21st.</a> Reserve your tickets today for these moving exhibitions at the Congregational Library &amp; Archives.</p><p> </p><h3>TEXTILE // Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry: Prayers in Thread</h3><p>During the long pandemic summer of 2020, nine United Church of Christ congregations in New Hampshire collaborated to make ten quilts that together memorialize the last words of George Floyd and document the painful experience of his death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in May 2020.</p><p><a href="https://www.saqm.org/" rel="nofollow">The Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry</a> uses the narrative art of quilting as both a healing balm and a catalyst for transformation. The creators hope that in viewing the quilts, people are led not only to remembrance, but to reflection and action. By creating space for sacred conversations within our communities, viewers begin to wash away the sin of white supremacy and racism—little by little, stitch by stitch.</p><p>These quilts are far more than a commentary on current events. They are a distillation of four hundred years of oppression. They express the devastating pain of America’s racial wounds. As Dr. Harriet Ward, member of Pilgrim United Church of Christ, Brentwood-Kingston and creator of three quilts for the Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry project so poignantly says, “‘I can’t breathe’ is the lamentation of centuries.”</p><p>In churches, schools, and colleges, the <em>Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry: Prayers in Thread</em> exhibition has become a powerful tool for provoking transformative conversations about race in the United States, contributing to Congregationalism’s long history of advancing social justice.</p><p> </p><h3>TEXT // Congregational Library &amp; Archives: Threads of Resistance</h3><p>For 170 years, the Congregational Library &amp; Archives has gathered and shared the story of Congregationalism and its impact in the United States and around the world. the<em> Threads of Resistance: Black Voices and Women’s Activism</em> exhibition was developed to accompany the Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry display and reveals the legacy of Black truth-speaking and the history of Congregational women’s activism over the centuries.</p><p>Letters, sermons, appeals, poetry, and other materials tell the stories of the first ordained African American Congregational minister, activists who founded anti-slavery and temperance societies, enslaved men and women who crafted confessions and relations of faith, and women who rejected the dominant theological frameworks of their time to become ministers, missionaries, and reformers.</p><p>From works by well-known figures like Langston Hughes, Antoinette Brown Blackwell, and Lemuel Haynes, to materials from individuals whose names deserve greater recognition, such as Lydia Bourne, Sarah Parker Remond, and Ella Hobart, this exhibition of materials drawn from the extensive collections of the Congregational Library &amp; Archives illustrates the diverse ways that women and men have challenged the status quo across the centuries of Congregational history.</p><p>Please get in touch with your questions via email at <a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org">info@14beacon.org</a> or by phone at 617-523-0470 ext 223.</p><p> </p><p>In connection with this exhibition, we are pleased to host a special conversation at the Congregational Library on Monday, June 19th from 2-4 pm EDT with the leaders of the Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry, Rev. Mark Koyama, Dr. Harriet Ward, and Kathy Blair. Tickets for this event are free, but extremely limited.

Talking about matricultural systems allows us to consider as primary the cultural context of a given society as perceived, constructed, and lived by its women. Similar to other cultural systems such as art, religion, or mathematics, employing the heuristic of matriculture allows for, among other things: cross-cultural comparisons; fresh insights into the social roles of women, men, otherwise identified, children, and the entire community of humans, animals, and the environment; and/or renewed understandings of historically mis-labelled cultures. With Guédon’s work in mind, then, and based on Geertzian principles, the concept of matriculture is both a model <i>of</i> reality by rendering the structure of matricultures apprehensible and a model <i>for</i> reality, where psychological relationships are organized under its guidance.</span></p><p><span>We encourage submissions from scholars around the world who are ready to take a new look at the ways in which people - historically and currently - have organized meaningful relationships amongst themselves and with the natural environment, the myths, customs, and laws which support these relationships, and the ways in which researchers have documented and perhaps mis-labeled the matricultures they have encountered.</span></p><p><span>For more information, visit our website: <a href="https://www.networkonculture.ca/activities/matrix" rel="nofollow">https://www.networkonculture.ca/activities/matrix</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Linnéa Rowlatt</p><p>Managing Editor</p><p><em>Matrix: A Journal for Matricultural Studies</em></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:lrowlatt@networkonculture.ca">lrowlatt@networkonculture.ca</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.networkonculture.ca/activities/matrix" target="_blank">https://www.networkonculture.ca/activities/matrix</a></div></div></div></description>

Phiroze Vasunia, Michael J. Franklin, Andrew Rudd, and others have commented at length on the ways in which English writers related to India during the Romantic period. Works by writers like William Jones, Phebe Gibbes, Robert Southey, Sydney Owenson, and Wilke Collins reveal the extent to which India became a point of creative fixation as well as cultural appropriation. The translations of many works of ancient and medieval Indic texts were important to the galvanization of the British literary imagination. We might ask if there is a way of amending some of the injurious perspectives that evolved over the course of the nineteenth century viz. India as the British Empire expanded its foothold, though not without appreciation for many areas of genuine exchange and learning between the philosophical traditions of Britain, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent that simultaneously occurred. English interest in India began during the Renaissance; however, during the Romantic period, the British Empire pivoted to India as its influence in the Atlantic weakened, following the American and Haitian Revolutions.</p>
<p>This panel explores how Anglophone writers translated and interpreted foundational religious texts in the Hindu tradition, such as the <em>Bhagavad Gita </em>and the <em>Upanishads</em>, as well as Sanskrit literary works such as Kalidasa's <em>Shakuntala. </em>We are particularly interested in papers that reflect on the underlying spiritual message and worldview of these texts and how it impacted literary creativity on both sides of the Atlantic. </p>

Phiroze Vasunia, Michael J. Franklin, Andrew Rudd, and others have commented at length on the ways in which English writers related to India during the Romantic period. Works by writers like William Jones, Phebe Gibbes, Robert Southey, Sydney Owenson, and Wilke Collins reveal the extent to which India became a point of creative fixation as well as cultural appropriation. The translations of many works of ancient and medieval Indic texts were important to the galvanization of the British literary imagination. We might ask if there is a way of amending some of the injurious perspectives that evolved over the course of the nineteenth century viz. India as the British Empire expanded its foothold, though not without appreciation for many areas of genuine exchange and learning between the philosophical traditions of Britain, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent that simultaneously occurred. English interest in India began during the Renaissance; however, during the Romantic period, the British Empire pivoted to India as its influence in the Atlantic weakened, following the American and Haitian Revolutions.</p>
<p>This panel explores how Anglophone writers translated and interpreted foundational religious texts in the Hindu tradition, such as the <em>Bhagavad Gita </em>and the <em>Upanishads</em>, as well as Sanskrit literary works such as Kalidasa's <em>Shakuntala. </em>We are particularly interested in papers that reflect on the underlying spiritual message and worldview of these texts and how it impacted literary creativity on both sides of the Atlantic. </p>

			<title>[ June 15, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Humans and Other Animals: Multifaith Responses to the Significance and Symbolism of Animals in Science and Religion Dialogue</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/111234</link>
						<description><ul><li>Deadline for abstract submission MIDNIGHT 15th June 2023</li>
<li>Deadline for RESIDENTIAL conference registration MIDNIGHT 6th August 2023</li>
<li>Deadline for NON-RESIDENTIAL conference registration 23rd August 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>The committee invites submission of papers that address the significance and symbolism of non-human animals within the science and religion dialogue. The committee welcome submissions from all faith perspectives and authors are invited to address the theme from a range of perspectives. For more details see https://www.srforum.org/srf-conference-2023-cambridge</p>
<p>The animal and religions dialogue has been growing over the last 25 years, the aim of this conference is to bring this broadening area of scholarship to dialogue with the science-religion arena through two broad strands:</p>
<p><em>Strand 1: </em>Perhaps viewed as the most prevalent interaction of science, religion and human-animal interactions, this strand focuses on ethical and environmental issues raised by anthropocentric views of the relationship. This strand focuses on animals in science and religion as the direct area of interest and thus includes but is not limited to matters of ecology, stewardship, and animal ethics (broadly construed and may relate to matters of urbanisation and conservation as well as animal-human relations).</p>
<p><em>Strand 2: </em>The second strand recognises the broader implications of scientific and interdisciplinary approaches to non-human animals on wider areas of theological enquiry. This strand examines the new perspectives that can be bought to the science-religion conversation through critical engagement with “the animal” adding further depth, theory, or methodology to our theological discussion. Areas of enquiry for this strand may include (but aren’t limited to) the matter of bestiaries, mythology, and fables, the relationship(s) between humans and animals, Incarnation and embodiment, Ritual / proto-religious behaviour in animals and textual and ritual meanings of animal bodies.</p>

Charles demanded that puritans change voting practices, baptismal policies, and laws, and he also cast an eye on local resources such as forests, a valuable source of masts for the English navy. In the face of this threat to local rule, colonists had to decide whether they would submit to the commissioners’ authority, which they viewed as arbitrary because it was not accountable to the people, or whether they would mobilize to defy the crown.</strong></p><p><strong>Those resisting the crown included not just freemen (voters) but also people often seen as excluded or marginalized such as non-freemen, indentured servants, and women. Together they crafted a potent regional constitutional culture in defiance of Charles II that was characterized by a skepticism of metropolitan ambition, a defense of civil and religious liberties, and a conviction that self-government was divinely sanctioned.</strong></p><p><strong>The event is free to all, but registration is required via this link: </strong><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FXyxEovIRASqkdZXmkR5Mg" rel="nofollow"><strong>https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FXyxEovIRASqkdZXmkR5Mg</strong></a></p><p><strong>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.</strong></p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><strong>For more information, please email <a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org?subject=A%20Constitutional%20Culture">info@14beacon.org</a>.</strong></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org">info@14beacon.org</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.congregationallibrary.org/events/constitutionalculture" target="_blank">https://www.congregationallibrary.org/events/constitutionalculture</a></div></div></div></description>

This talk will address parallel questions of hybridity and religious identity through the historical analysis of two religious spaces. The first is the Chunyang guan 純陽觀 in Xinjin 新津. First imagined and built in the late Qing dynasty as a space devoted to the three religions, in fact it functioned as a fully religious space only for a short time. In the early to mid-twentieth century it was variously used as an orphanage and school, and is now a museum and tea house, while still holding a liminal religious significance. The second example comes from a preliminary investigation of several different guildhalls (huiguan 會館) in Sichuan.  Originally multivalent spaces representing the business interests and religious beliefs of migrant communities entering Sichuan in the mid Qing dynasty, after losing their supporting communities and undergoing various historical vicissitudes, many are now in disrepair, shifting from religious to secular spaces, or being re-assigned to a different religious tradition, often Buddhist. The case of the Yuwang gong 禹王宮 in Lizhuang 李莊, now the Huiguang si 慧光寺 Buddhist monastery, is emblematic. Because of their shifting and fragile identities, their movement from sacralized to secularized or viceversa, the spaces under investigation are undercategorized, thus overlooked, understudied and marginalized. These examples might help in the historical investigation of other shifting religious sites in different parts of China.</p><p> </p><p>在調研四川及其周邊地區宗教傳統的過程中，文本與儀式中的宗教實踐呈現出多樣性與混雜性的特徵。本次講座通過對兩個宗教空間的史料分析，探討混雜性與宗教属性的平行问题。第一個案例是新津的純陽觀。此觀建於晚清，最初被想像為一個尊崇三教的空間，但事實上它只在短時間內完全發揮宗教空間的功能。自二十世紀起，它成為一個多功能的場所，二十世紀初期至中期曾被用作孤兒院兼學校，現在是一個博物館兼茶館，儘管仍具備有限的宗教意義。第二個例子來自對四川幾個不同會館的初步調研。清中期移民群體進入四川，建造了代表他們商業利益和宗教信仰的多功能空間，後來這些空間失去支持群體，又歷經歲月變遷，現在很多都年久失修，從宗教空間轉變為世俗空間，或者重新被賦予另一種宗教傳統，通常是佛教傳統。李莊的禹王宮，現在的佛教聖地慧光寺，就是典型的案例。由於它們多變而脆弱的属性，以及世俗化或神聖化的轉變，我調研的這些空間沒有被合理歸類，因而也被邊緣化，疏於重視和研究。這些例子有助於從歷史學的角度研究中國各地其他處於變化中的宗教場所。</p><p> </p><p><b><u>About the Speaker</u></b><b>:</b></p><p>Elena Valussi is a senior Lecturer in the History Department at Loyola University Chicago.

Robert E. Buswell Jr. conceptualises currents and countercurrents to describe the diverse regional strands of influence on the East Asian Buddhist tradition. Beside cross-regional developments, currents or subcurrents within a regional Buddhist tradition can manifest in the convergence and divergence between institutionalised teachings and local practices. Dominated mainly by lay people’s experiences of Buddhism, local practices and popular beliefs usually present a considerable degree of religious and cultural hybridity. Moreover, at a local level, religious rituals and liturgical performances are often integrated with vernacular genres of storytelling such as literature and drama. Since the inception of the eastward Buddhist missionary in the second or third century, some of these local currents prosper concomitantly with Buddhist monasteries that have been centres of regional learning and practice, while others are considered illegitimate and constantly banned by political authorities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This conference invites graduate students from the UK and Europe to submit proposals for presentations exploring local practices and popular beliefs in East Asian Buddhism.

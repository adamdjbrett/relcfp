<p>Meaning in life is one of the most fundamental philosophical problems, discussed for centuries but having acquired considerable depth in English-speaking philosophy over the past 30 years. Is there any meaning in life? If so, how can we find it? Can life be meaningful if death is the ultimate end of our existence? How is meaning related to well-being and happiness? What are the moral implications of philosophical debates on meaning in life? Can life be objectively meaningful, or can it only be subjectively meaningful? What are the links between God and meaning? What do we mean by ‘meaning’ in the first place?</p>
<p>The aim of the conference is to address these fundamental questions from a wide range of philosophical perspectives, including both western and non-western traditions. Potential topics could include, but are not limited to: theoretical approaches to meaning in/of life; the relationship between death and meaning; anti-natalism and nihilism; procreation and extinction; spiritual, religious, and psychological implications of meaning; linguistic, metaphysical, and epistemological issues concerning meaning; meaning in applied ethics, such as bioethics, environmental ethics, and transhumanism; the roles of narrative, identity, and agency; comparative accounts of meaning in religio-philosophical traditions around the world; implications of meaning for health, well-being, or virtue.</p>
<p><strong>Call for papers: </strong></p>
<p>We invite submissions concerning meaning in/of life as considered in the field of philosophy. Please send an abstract of approximately 500 words (excluding any references), prepared for blind review, to <a href="mailto:philosophymeaninglife@gmail.com">philosophymeaninglife@gmail.com</a>.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: Phenomenological Psychopathology: Who, What and How. An analysis of key figures, advancements and challenges<br/><br/><p><strong>Call for papers</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Phenomenological Psychopathology: Who, What and How? </em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>An analysis of key figures, advancements and challenges</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Issue of “Frontiers in Psychology” </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Edited by </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Susi Ferrarello, Francesca Brencio, Valeria Bizzari, Magnus Englander</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Phenomenology and psychopathology are two disciplines whose development intertwined over the past century thanks to key figures such as Binswanger, Jaspers, Fanon, Basaglia. Phenomenology offers psychopathology an approach that looks at the lived experience of the patient without presuppositions and preconceptions. Psychopathology offers phenomenology the possibility to investigate the manifold forms of plurality, a topic that only tangentially has been investigated by philosophy in its history. In that sense, phenomenological notions such as epoche’, first and second person perspective, lived time, and intersubjectivity are key to the advancement of a psychopathology, capable of truly understanding the lived experience of the person affected by a disorder and integrate it in society. Consequently, disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolarism, borderline personality have gained a deeper understanding and integration in the society thanks to the combination of phenomenological studies within a multidisciplinary context (music, dance, theatre, visual arts).<br/> <br/> The goal of this issue is to collect papers that focus on:<br/> - key concepts, advancements and challenges in the development of phenomenological psychopathology and clinical applications<br/> - propose a theoretical overview of the major perspectives to contemporary challenges within phenomenological psychopathology such as embodiment, lived-time, interaffectivity, intentionality, existential moods<br/> - overview of theoretical perspectives to contemporary challenges within specific conditions studied by phenomenological psychopathology<br/> - tackle the study of specific emotions (e.g. envy, melancholy, resentment) contributing to the arousal of specific disorders (depression, BPD, bipolarism, etc.)<br/> -discussion of methodologies in use to conduct studies in phenomenological psychopathologies and concrete tools that phenomenology can offer (for instance, the phenomenological interview) and a critical analysis of the phenomenological gaze in the clinical meeting and in the therapeutic setting. - provide the readers with key studies in which the phenomenological toolbox is used in empirical and clinical occasions.<br/> <br/> Accordingly, this issue is interested in the following scope of research concerning phenomenological psychopathology:<br/> - Theoretical investigation of development of phenomenological psychopathology and its challenges in the empirical practice<br/> - Clinical applications of phenomenological psychopathology on specific disorders (autism, schizophrenia, borderline, bipolar)<br/> - Epistemological understanding of the limits of clinical applications and theoretical studies<br/> - Discussion of methodologies (tools, phenomenologically-informed therapies) in phenomenological psychopathology and their limits.</p>

We invite participants to consider how might Jewish studies as a field be positioned to interrogate time as a concept. This conference will be held <strong>February 2-3, 2023, online</strong> with an optional in-person reception and closing event.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to think through questions that relate to how contemporary studies of Jews, Judaisms, and Jewishness offer new perspectives or rescue old concepts in the understanding of time throughout history. How can Jewish studies illuminate questions about time? How do the societies, organizations, or figures we research deal with temporal problems? We welcome proposals that engage/discuss Judaisms, Jewishness, and time in myriad ways, such as memory, narrative, and mourning; history and historiography; modernity, coloniality, and the nation-state; indigeneity and deep time; calendars, materiality, monuments, and ritual; ecology and climate change; the experience of time and other phenomenological issues; messianism and prophecy; or other topics.</p><p>The conference is open to all graduate students working in Jewish studies and adjacent fields. As an interdisciplinary conference, we welcome papers from many fields, including but not limited to Religious Studies, Anthropology, Sociology, Music, Literature, Folklore, Film Studies, Visual and Performance Art, History, and Political Science. Also, we encourage the proposal of unconventional presentations, including visual, musical, and performance arts.</p><p>We are excited to announce that this year’s Lillian Solotkin Keynote Lecture, titled “Memory Citizenship: Migration and Holocaust Memory in Contemporary Germany,” will be given by Dr. Michael Rothberg, 1939 Society Samuel Goetz Chair in Holocaust Studies and Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>Please send an abstract (maximum 300 words), a title for your presentation, and contact information, including name, email address, telephone number, and institution to <a href="mailto:jsgsacon@indiana.edu">jsgsacon@indiana.edu</a> by October 30.</strong> Abstracts will be evaluated based on quality and fit.

			<title>[ January 3, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Textures of Change: Social Imaginaries, Narratives, and the Possibility of Politics</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/103582</link>
						<description><p>The New School for Social Research Philosophy Department is hosting our annual Graduate Student Conference April 13-15th 2023 in person in New York City.  </p>
<p>This year’s topic is <strong>Textures of Change: Social Imaginaries, Narratives, and the Possibility of Politics</strong>.   </p>
<p><u><strong>Keynote Speakers:</strong></u></p>
<p>María Pía Lara (<em>Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana</em>)</p>
<p>Fanny Söderbäck (<em>Södertörn University</em>)</p>
<p>Eva Von Redecker (<em>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</em>)</p>
<p>It has become common for political theorists and philosophers to insist on the necessity of new imaginaries and narratives. Crises of authority, financial meltdowns, and environmental disasters compel us to look for alternative frameworks and practices. While the urgency of this claim is undeniable, the conceptual ground for the creation of new imaginaries and narratives is still unclear. How do we define imaginaries and narratives in relation to our political and social life? How can they become normative and generate conceptual and practical shifts? And who is in a position to shape, direct, and take ownership of these emergent conceptions?  </p>
<p>This conference focuses on the current debate on political imaginaries and narratives to investigate some of these questions. As a starting point, we propose to challenge standard Marxist or epistemological approaches to the topic that either interpret imaginaries and narratives as ideological projections (a product of false consciousness) or merely as individual, cognitive faculties. Rather, we suggest thinking about imaginaries and narratives as larger sensuous and embodied practices that re-orient material structures of domination and allow for a reflective rearticulation of collective demands. In particular, we set out to clarify: the meaning of “imaginaries” and/or “narratives” as forms of sense-making; their ability to shift existing discourses and power relations; the way in which they foster different ways of feeling, seeing, acting-in, and experiencing the world in a time of crisis; the way in which they are embedded in artistic and literary practices; and the way in which they address—or fail to address—marginalized subjects.</p>
<p>We invite papers that focus on the concepts of “social imaginary” and “narrative,” as well as on the connection between the two, and on their political and ethical implications. It is our conviction that a critical understanding of these concepts can only emerge from attending to how they are practically embodied and situated in our practices. In this spirit, we welcome, in addition to papers aimed at conceptual clarification, papers that provide specific accounts of alternative forms of praxis, including (but not limited to) leftist, feminist, anti-racist, decolonial, abolitionist, indigenous, environmentalist, and utopian imaginaries and narratives.</p>
<p>We are accepting submissions of up to <strong>4000</strong> words. Please also submit a brief academic bio.</p>
<p>Please contact socialimaginarynarrative@gmail.com with any queries or submissions. </p>

			<title>[ October 19, 2022 -  October 21, 2022] Conference or similar: 2nd IEF International Colloquium ROADS TO CARE, 19th-21st October 2022 (FLUC - Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the University of Coimbra)</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/103586</link>
						<description>Venue: Faculdade de Letras, Largo da Porta Férrea<br/><br/><p>The extreme vulnerability of humans and contemporary societies, recently laid bare by the Covid-19 pandemic, has led to extreme poverty, famine and numerous sorts of inequality, injustice, and exploitation affecting a vast proportion of the global human population. Different and unexpected forms of vulnerability felt worldwide urge philosophy and philosophers to reflect upon the present situation and to take action towards finding humane and well-reasoned answers to some of today’s most pressing problems. To this end, and in line with its core commitment to the “philosophy of care,” the IEF aims to foster an interdisciplinary dialogue between philosophers and all of those who, in their own fields of inquiry and expertise, are engaged in taking care of the Earth and its inhabitants by doing their utmost to mitigate the perils currently threatening our planetary household. A precise definition of the nature, aims and methods of a “philosophy of care” has yet to be established, but its scope has widened to encompass major challenges, notably the promotion of inclusive and democratic societies, gender equality, climate and environmental sustainability, cultural, artistic and human heritage, and universal access to high-quality and affordable healthcare and education. These are the fundamental issues we hope to address in this colloquium.</p>
<p>In its 2nd edition, the colloquium will also pay tribute to Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo (1930-2004), former Portuguese prime-minister and a pioneering contributor to the development of the philosophy of care, whose life and work will be evoked by a special discussion panel. Apart from papers associated with the colloquium’s four main sections (see below), we also welcome contributions on M. L. Pintasilgo’s thought and legacy, broadly construed.</p></description>

			<title>[ October 12, 2022 -  October 14, 2022] Conference or similar: Intentionality as Tendency</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/103502</link>
						<description>Venue: Residenzplatz 2<br/><br/><p>Intentionality, in phenomenology, is understood as one of the central features of consciousness, in particular as that which defines the structure of acts. A perception, a judgment, an act of will, or a feeling are intentional insofar as they are directed at objects or states of affairs. The characterization of intentional consciousness as object-directedness has been reassessed and adjusted in the developmentof the phenomenological movement: for instance, with Husserl’s analyses of temporality and the passive syntheses, Heidegger’s discussion of mood, and Merleau-Ponty inquiry into the different forms of behavior and bodily intentionality. That said, the characterization of intentionality as object-directedness is still often taken for granted, although the mentioned analyses also motivate the view that intentionality is not primarily, let alone exclusively, to be understood as directedness at a determinate object.</p>
<p>In the texts written around the years 1913/14, Husserl explicitly concentrates on the distinction between object-directed and nonobject-directed intentionality and works intensively on the characterization of their relation. Thus, he not only develops his phenomenological investigations of consciousness by shedding light on the structures of object-directed acts (as we can see, for instance in Ideas I), but rather extends the focus of his inquiry by also investigating the intentional processes that do not seem to already have a defined object. Husserl uses the notion of ‘tendency’ to refer to the process-like intentionality that is not (yet) directed at a determinate object. Crucially, he often indicates that the indeterminate tending-towards should be seen as the most basic and encompassing mode of being of consciousness. The structures of accomplishment of intentionality as tendency are partly discussed in the manuscripts Husserl wrote for the revision of the Sixth Logical Investigation (notably Hua XX/2) and later in the Analyses Concerning Active and Passive Synthesis (Hua XI and XXXI) as well as in the manuscripts collected by Landgrebe in the work Experience and Judgment. But the most extensive analyses of intentionality as tendency - embracing the doxastic, volitional, and affective dimension of conscious life - can be found in the recently published Studien zur Struktur des Bewusstseins (Hua XLIII).</p>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to systematically and historically investigate the characterization of intentionality as a tendency. Presentations will evaluate the systematic function of the analyses of intentionality as a tendency in the different fields of conscious experience, focusing on how Husserl’s analyses in the newly published Studien relate to alternative analyses on indeterminate intentionality, particularly to be found in the other phenomenological movements (e.g. the Munich and Göttingen circles or post-Husserlian phenomenology) as well as in the fields of philosophy of psychology and psychoanalysis. </p></description>

By adopting racialized perceptions of Catholic social action, Mexican católicas affirmed their power within the domestic sphere.

This will create a richer understanding of the story of Scotland’s Jewish communities, their local, national and international networks, and their place in broader Scottish society. Judaica are found in both religious and domestic settings, and reflect the stories of those who commissioned or acquired them, the environments in which they were made, and relationships between client and maker. Therefore, Judaica represent key evidence to help construct a more nuanced picture of Jewish life.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The aims and objectives of this research project are: </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To undertake a systematic investigation of the origins of Judaica in Scotland. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To explore how stylistic choices communicate cultural and religious identifications.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To apply these findings to the broader contextual knowledge of Jewish communities in Scotland to create a better understanding of inter- and intra-communal, national, and transnational exchanges.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To apply this knowledge to the development of collections at NMS that represent religious diversity in Scotland. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To inform the interpretation of faith, migration and identity as it applies to minority religious and ethnic groups in anticipation of the reconsideration of the Scotland galleries.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The prevailing historiography of migration in modern Scotland has focused on two balancing narratives: the Scottish diaspora and Christian immigrants that have challenged Scotland’s Presbyterian hegemony. Newer examinations of the experiences of migrant groups, however, reveal a diversity of perspectives on nineteenth and twentieth century Scottish society and the nation’s transcultural connections. <i>Judaica in Scotland </i>showcases the diversity of Scotland’s populations by using material evidence to provide important insights into Jewish religious and social structures between the establishment of Scotland’s first Jewish community in 1817 and now. Jewish communities have always been small in number, yet their substantial impact on Scottish life continues to add to the rich heritage and vibrancy of Scottish religious and cultural life. The various waves of Jewish migration responded not only to persecution in central and eastern Europe, but also to opportunities that led to new beginnings in Scotland. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>An emerging scholarly interest in the peripheral Jewish communities of the UK shows the importance of understanding the movement of people and ideas, processes of acculturation, and creation and maintenance of religious identities in these contexts. Notably, however, few studies critically examine and incorporate material evidence. The study of material culture nevertheless offers unique opportunities to better understand the nature of Jewish life in Scotland. Judaica – the broad term for objects related to Jewish ritual observance – plays a central role in the life of many Jews in both public and domestic settings. It reflects the story of the Jewish people and exhibits religious and cultural specificities that cast a light on the nature of Jewish experience in Scotland and the wider world. An understanding of what links Jewish devotional objects in Scotland to those who manufacture, import and use them can reveal a range of unexplored interconnections, whether social, economic, religious, cultural or aesthetic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The key research questions are:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Where did and does Judaica in Scotland originate? And what are the relationships between the origin of an object and to how it is understood and used?</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>What can the creation and circulation of Judaica tell us about Jewish/non-Jewish relations in Scotland?</span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ul><ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To what extent can we speak of identifiably or uniquely Scottish Judaica?</span></span></span> </span></span></span></li></ul><p> </p><p><span><span><span><b><span><span><span>Eligibility</span></span></span></b></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>At the University of Edinburgh, to study at postgraduate level you must normally hold a degree in an appropriate subject, with an excellent or very good classification (equivalent to first or upper second class honours in the UK), plus meet the entry requirements for the specific degree </span></span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&amp;edition=2022&amp;id=66" rel="nofollow"><span><span><span>programme</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>.

The focus will be on Jewish collections across Scotland, such as the Scottish Jewish Archives Centre and repositories held by religious organisations, places of worship, and private collections. Data collected from the analysis of objects will relate to design, production and exchange. This information will be used to construct an understanding of Judaica in Scotland and its relevance to the relationships among Jewish communities and wider Scottish society.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addressing the research questions, the project will investigate a range of ceremonial art and ritual objects found across Scotland. The candidate will thereby work with a range of stakeholders to produce the first systematic study of Judaica in Scotland and unlock this important body of evidence of Scottish Jewish life. Exploring material evidence from the 1800s to the present will enhance understandings of the story of Jews in Scotland, and will inform the future interpretation of objects of minority religions in Scotland at NMS, particularly as the organisation begins the reconsideration of the Scotland galleries.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the project, the candidate will have the opportunity to identify gaps in NMS collections and develop thinking around the collection of historical and contemporary faith-related objects in Scotland. This will ensure that NMS continues to collect and interpret objects that reflect the diversity of Scottish society in the past and present.</span></span></span> <span><span><span>They will also be required to familiarise themselves with Jewish museums in the United Kingdom and Europe in order to establish typological differences and similarities with material examined in Scotland. This may require research trips to institutions such as the Jewish Museum London, the Manchester Jewish Museum, and the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Tracing the history of the objects in the wider context of Jewish and Scottish cultural and religious history will necessarily entail an application of current theoretical approaches in the interpretation of material culture. Thereby the student will develop their competence in archival research and the study of the history and provenance of objects. Researching and recording object biographies will also be instrumental in analysing the cultural context within which the material was created and used.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Dr Hannah Holtschneider, Senior Lecturer in Jewish Studies, University of Edinburgh, UK</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:h.holtschneider@ed.ac.uk">h.holtschneider@ed.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/hannah-holtschneider" target="_blank">https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/hannah-holtschneider</a></div></div></div></description>

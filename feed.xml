			<title>[ March 15, 2024 -  March 16, 2024] Conference or similar: Second Annual Max Stirner Symposium</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/115314</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p><strong>Stirner and the Theory of Anarchism</strong></p>
<p>Max Stirner has been largely excluded from traditional academic discourse, with much of the work on him being produced within the anarchist tradition. This year’s annual Max Stirner Symposium seeks to rectify this academic exclusion while simultaneously respecting the non-academic contributions to Stirner scholarship by setting the theme of the conference as “Stirner and Anarchist Theory.” This includes a variety of approaches from purely philosophical questions related to anarchism, to the ways in which anarchist theory expands or restricts possible anarchist praxis. </p>
<p>We seek to investigate questions like: What can Stirner say about the metaphysical or ontological basis of anarchism? Does Stirner provide us with a sufficient theoretical grounding for his anarchist praxis? Can Stirner’s theory of subjectivity withstand the 20th Century critiques of the subject? Does Stirner instead prefigure some of these critiques of subjectivity? What is the status of the legitimacy of metaphysics for Stirner? Does he reject or rely on metaphysics? Do the developments of phenomenology pose problems for Stirner’s notion of property? What is the status of the subject-object dichotomy for Stirner? Can the centrality of the self as an egoist be defended? What are the advantages and disadvantages of a theoretical individualism for political praxis? Is theory even important to Stirner? Is his philosophy instead an atheoretical approach to ethics? What is the basis for organization for Stirner if any? Does the notion of the Unique problematize organizing, or does it aid it? Is organizing possible for an individualist theory?</p></description>

			<title>[ June 20, 2024 -  June 21, 2024] Conference or similar: Homo religiosus &amp; homo technicus: discontinuities and congruencies. Theological, philosophical and psychological approaches</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/115298</link>
						<description>Venue: Aleea Universității, no. 1<br/><br/><p>Homo religiosus and homo technicus define two contextual paradigms of man in the course of history: man who lives in the religious horizon, a constant of his existence, and man who coordinates his life in the quotidian references of technological development. In essence, his life is strongly impacted by new technologies. The same man in the same society, but a society in constant transformation in all its aspects.</p>
<p>The conference intends a multilateral approach to the relationship between the religious dimension of man and the techno-scientific conditions of quotidian life. What is the relationship between homo religiosus and homo technicus and what are the perspectives of this relationship? Does current scientific development invalidate religious truth? What are the challenges of new technologies, especially artificial intelligence, for religious and ethical integrity?</p>
<p>Panels</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Homo religiosus and homo technicus - definitions, interpretations, contextualizations </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The validity of religious truth and new technologies: antagonism or congruence?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of new technologies on man from a theological, ethical, philosophical and psychological perspective</p>
</li>

			<title>[ November 10, 2023] Conference or similar: Integritate și redefinire. Omul în orizontul multi-dimensional al societății contemporane</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/115302</link>
						<description>Venue: Aleea Universității, no. 1<br/><br/><p>O simplă analiză asupra realității lumii de astăzi, a anului 2023, ne confirmă faptul că într-un interval de câțiva zeci de ani morfologia societății s-a schimbat radical: localul a devenit global în sensul vizibilității și a comprimării spațiului prin noile tehnici de comunicare, granițele dintre culturi și religii au devenit fluide prin relațiile dialogice și dinamica migrației, tendințele economice au creat rețele trans-naționale, care au generat noi reconfigurări politice, iar dezvoltările tehnologice au impulsionat noi arhitecturi ale ritmului cotidian. În acest context multi-dimensional, omul se simte mult mai pregnant pe sine însuși, simte mai intens relația cu celălalt și cu mediul înconjurător și caută să-și definească mult mai bine situarea în societate.</p>
<p>Omul este o identitate care sintetizează în sine un complex de experiențe cotidiene: religioase, sociale, psihologice, tehnice, medicale, economice, culturale. Iar riscul fragmentarizării vieții poate genera uitarea de sine, care este una dintre cele mai tragice forme de anxietate. Din acest considerent, miza integrității și a redefinirii de sine a devenit o coordonată esențială în registrul vieții. </p>
<p>Conferința își propune să fie un forum de dezbateri asupra unor întrebări care mizează pe faptul existențial: Cum ne păstrăm integritatea într-o societate multi-dimensională care ne provoacă printr-o serie de riscuri? Cum ne redefinim valorile axiologice în complexul experiențelor cotidiene contemporane? Ce aport are religia, filosofia, psihologia, medicina, cultura în articularea integrității umane?   </p></description>

<p> </p>
<p>At the end of 1920, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s first novel, <em>This Side of Paradise</em>, explored the crises of a new generation who had “grown up to find all Gods dead… all faiths in man shaken.” Scholars and theologians concur that American literature, like the culture at large, was undergoing a passage from a spiritual to a secular outlook throughout the 1920s and 30s. This transition was so dramatic and widespread that that the years between 1925-1935 have been termed “the American Religious Depression.” Indeed, many texts from these two decades present their own version of the larger cultural secularization thesis.</p>
<p>But while the secularization thesis is not wrong, it does not provide a complete picture of American literary history between the World Wars. This project seeks to fill this gap by examining the role of spiritual discourse in the literature of the era. It is true that many modernist texts convey a sense of cultural decay or spiritual darkness through cynicism, iconoclasm, or unintelligibility. However, there were a number of American writers who, despite the zeitgeist in which they lived and worked, still insisted on extending either hope, faith, or charity to their readers.</p>
<p>A number of scholars, critics, and editors called for a “spiritual readjustment” in American literature during the 1920s and 30s, and a cadre of writers were working towards this "readjustment" in their fiction or poetry. Some wrote using spiritually coded terms such as transcendence, surrender, sacrifice, or mystery. Others wrote within Judeo-Christian traditions, but were focused on righting injustices within those traditions. There were some who understood faith--although not necessarily religious faith-- as a human necessity. In this expanded sense, faith can mean belief in humanity, meaning, or commitment to progress. </p>
<p>This volume will consist of readings of American texts from the 1920s and 1930s which foreground the presence or impact of the following spiritually-inflected terms in conversation with the ethos of literary modernism:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Hope</p>
<p> Belief</p>
<p>Transcendence</p>
<p>Mystery</p>
<p>Compassion</p>
<p>Connectedness or Community</p>
<p>Sacrifice</p>
<p>Redemption, among other spiritually-inflected terms</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This edited collection will trace the resurgence of these metaphysical concepts in the work of American writers who were not identified with formal religion as well as those who were. I am happy to receive proposals for chapters which reconsider the work of canonical authors, but would especially welcome proposals treating lesser known or neglected writers of the 20s and 30s. </p>
<p>Please submit chapter proposals of 300-500 words by January 8, 2024 to Windy Petrie at <a href="mailto:wpetrie@apu.edu">wpetrie@apu.edu</a>. Potential contributors will receive a response by January 26. Complete chapters of between 7,000- 10,000 words will be due July 15.</p>

			<title>[ March 7, 2024 -  March 8, 2024] Conference or similar: Between Power and Authority: Arendt on the Constitution and the Courts</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/115142</link>
						<description>Venue: 1448 Annadale Road<br/><br/><p>The U.S. Supreme Court today faces a crisis of legitimacy. More than half of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Court—the lowest in over three decades. Following a slate of rulings on abortion, affirmative action, student debt, and freedom of religion, an increasing number of Americans no longer believe the Court is impartial, viewing it as simply another partisan institution. As a result, many are calling for various reforms of the Court, including term limits and packing the court. At the same time, the Court has, even at this moment, has struck down racially motivated gerrymandering in Alabama and has refused to accept the Independent State Legislature Theory that would allow states to overturn the will of their voters. There is little doubt that politics is at play in the Supreme Court; at the same time, the Court still gives credence to the idea of the rule of law and not men. </p>
<p>In <em>On Revolution</em>, Hannah Arendt places the American constitutional tradition at the center of her inquiry into the founding and preserving of political freedom. The success of the American Revolution, for her, consisted in two things: its unleashing of citizen power through the principle of  federalist dispersion of power and its institutionalization of authority in the Supreme Court and the United States Constitution. Regarding the former, Arendt argues that the embrace of federalism allowed for the multiplication and flourishing of power within a stable system. Regarding the latter, Arendt offers an original reading of the Supreme Court as the successor of the Roman Senate. The Court's authority combined with the surprising fact that the Constitution came to be worshiped allowed the United States to achieve authority for its laws absent religious sanction. This authority tied together permanence and change, permitting the country to develop and grow while also maintaining order and stability. In short, the combination of power and authority that emerged from  the worship of the United States Constitution became the modern condition for the possibility of founding free government.</p>

<p>This conference aims to bring together scholars of Arendt’s constitutional thought and those working in political and legal theory more broadly to pursue the following questions: Is the Supreme Court still a legal institution, one that wields and deserves the authority imbued by the rule of law? Is the Supreme Court simply an undemocratic institution of power? If the latter, should we abandon the charade that the Supreme Court is above politics?  Or, should we work to uphold the reality and the illusion that the Court is a legal and not simply a political institution? Any answers to these questions request that we face what is lost if and when the Supreme Court is no longer recognized as a seat of authority. We are especially interested in papers that address: Arendt’s conception of power and/or authority, Arendt’s constitutional and/or legal theory, and the relevance of all of this for current discussions of the Supreme Court and constitutional politics.</p>

<p>We invite submissions of paper proposals in the form of an extended abstract (500-1,000 words). Papers should be suitable for a 20 to 25 minute presentation, to be followed by a 15 minute Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Submission Deadline: <strong>15th of December, 2023</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>The nature of concepts continues to be one of the most fundamental conundrum around which philosophical reflection has converged. Understanding the role of concepts and their intersection with other dimensions of experience is directly related to investigating “human nature” and the structure of world and reality. Inquiries into the functioning of concepts rest at the heart not only of an internal bifurcation in Classical phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger) but have notably played a pivotal role in analytical debates (Russell, Moore). Especially in the last 30 years, the philosophical discussion about the role of concepts and the nature of conceptual content has been mainly subsumed within the dichotomous debate about conceptualism and non-conceptualism. Scholars have been engaged in classifying concepts (Benoist, Peacocke), determining their relation to perception (Sellars, McDowell, Brewer, Hopp), negating/limiting their cognitive role (Dreyfus) or accounting for a non-conceptual content of perception (Dretske, Travis, Bermúdez). This extremely intricate, yet rich and fruitful debate has attracted scholars from different traditions of thought who have engaged in metaphysical and epistemological analysis in the broadest sense. In order to answer the question regarding the nature of the concept, scholars have employed various strategies, either through an investigation into the history of philosophy – from Aristotle, to Hume, Kant, Hegel, Husserl, and Wittgenstein – or by attempting to approach the question from both the analytical and continental traditions: exploiting pragmatism, phenomenology, and philosophy of language.<br/> <br/> The conference aims to gather diverse perspectives of the topic at hand and enrich critical debate. To that end, the conference will bring together scholars from diverse backgrounds in order to discuss the key problematics concerning the nature of conceptual/non-conceptual content, such as: What are concepts? How shall we understand the relationship between the conceptual and non-conceptual spheres? What is at stake in the conceptual/non-conceptualism debate?</p>
<p>Papers are welcome that try to answer these and related questions. Suitable topics may include, but are not limited to:<br/> -       the nature of concepts<br/> -       the origin of concepts<br/> -       the relationship between concepts and perception<br/> -       the relationship between concepts and knowledge<br/> -       the role of concepts in human experience in general<br/> -       the nature of concepts versus the nature of the world<br/> -       critical analyses of the debate on conceptualism/non-conceptualism</p>
<p><strong>Details of the conference</strong></p>

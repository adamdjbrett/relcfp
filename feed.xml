			<title>[ January 27, 2023 -  January 28, 2023] Conference or similar: 1st Hegelian Society of Spirit Conference</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/102394</link>
						<description>Venue: Ltd 38/39 Fitzwilliam Square<br/><br/><p><strong>HEGEL AND HEGELIANISM TODAY</strong></p>
<p>In light of the resurgence of interest in the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel, the question of what remains at the core of Hegel’s philosophy has become increasingly pertinent. Taking this into consideration, we are also wondering how we are supposed to evaluate the Hegelian philosophy that has succeeded the initial impact of Hegel’s philosophy. This is a timely and unavoidable concern that Hegel scholars must face, one which reassembles the philosophical scene after Hegel’s death with the split between left-Hegelians, right-Hegelian, and young Hegelians all of whom misconstrued Hegel in some element or another. And since the history of Hegel scholarship until today has amounted to a bad game of telephone, we are wondering what makes contemporary Hegel scholarship and Hegelian philosophy different from this trend, if at all?</p>
<p>This conference seeks to explore two major concerns then: (1) when we look at Hegel’s work, what are we drawing from it as the core to his systematization of philosophy and how does it concern us today? And (2) in light of the proliferation of works on Hegel, how are we evaluating the value of these works as well as their relevance to Hegel’s philosophy? Therefore, this conference welcomes papers that focus on Hegel’s main texts the Phenomenology of Spirit and the Science of Logic, as well as other works by Hegel such as his early theological writings, The Philosophy of Right, the Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and others. We also welcome texts that enter into conversations with the interactions of Marxism and psychoanalysis with Hegel’s philosophy, as well as papers that address the work of authors such as Slavoj Zizek, Alenka Zupancic, Mladen Dolar, Alain Badiou, Adrian Johnston, Todd McGowan, Rebecca Comay, Frank Ruda, Susan Buck-Morss, Robert Brandom, Robert Pippin, Rocio Zambrano, and other contemporary Hegel scholars and commentators.</p>
<p><strong>Topics Suggested</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to be a Hegelian today?</li>
<li>Is Hegel dead? Or are we dead in the eyes of Hegel?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between the Phenomenology of Spirit and the Science of Logic?</li>
<li>What is a beginning in Hegel’s philosophy?</li>
<li>What is the end of Hegel’s philosophy?</li>
<li>What has changed in contemporary Hegelian scholarship from 20th century Hegelianism?</li>
<li>What is a Hegelian politics? And does Hegel genuinely offer an emancipatory project?</li>
<li>What is a Hegelian ethics? And how does it differ from other ethical orientations?</li>
<li>What is the role of religion in Hegel’s work from his early work to his more mature work starting with the Phenomenology of Spirit?</li>
<li>What is the Absolute for Hegel? And what is so radical about the Hegelian Absolute?</li>
<li>What kind of Hegelian responses can be given to contemporary neo-Kantianisms?</li>
<li>What kinds of correctives are needed in understanding the relationship between Hegel and Marx?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between Hegelianism and Marxism?</li>
<li>What is Hegel’s relationship to psychoanalysis?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between Hegel and Freud?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between Hegel and Lacan?</li>
<li>What kind of Hegelian responses can be given to contemporary accelerationisms?</li>
<li>What kind of Hegelian responses can be given to speculative realism?</li>
<li>Did the Zizekian rereading of Hegel through Lacan truly reclaim Hegel after his disavowal throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries?</li>
<li>What is the impact of Reza Negarestani’s Intelligence and Spirit to Hegelian philosophy? Do its Pittsburgh Hegelian roots aid its project or ultimately hinder it?</li>
<li>With the development of new North American Hegelianisms in the work of Adrian Johnston, Rebecca Comay, and Todd McGowan, what do they captivate or fail to understand about Hegelian philosophy?</li>
<li>What is the impact of Pittsburgh Analytic Hegelianism (Sellars, McDowell, Pippin, Brandom)? And does it captivate or miss the heart of Hegel’s philosophy?</li>
<li>What is the impact of Slovene Lacanian Hegelianism (Zizek, Zupancic, Dolar)? And does it captivate or miss the heart of Hegel’s philosophy?</li>
<li>What are we to make out of the major differences between contemporary Hegelian schools? (For example, the Pittsburgh School and the Slovene School)</li>

<p><strong>Hell in modern fantasy</strong> is usually a far cry from traditional depictions in major world religions—the dry and dusty hells of ancient Mesopotamia and the Classical world, the ambiguous Hel of the Norse, the fiery pit and everlasting torment of medieval Christianity and Islam, the purgatorial hells of reincarnative religions like Buddhism and Hinduism.</p>
<p>How do creators of fantasy imagine Hell differently? And more importantly, why? What do these depictions have to tell us about what is hellish in our modern world?</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The mystical spiritual descent: what can be gained from a descent to hell</li>
<li>The escape from hell: What is saved, and what is left behind</li>
<li>The harrowing of hell: the rescue of others from hell</li>
<li>The pact with hell: self-damnation or turning the tables</li>
<li>The intersection of race, racism, and hell</li>
<li>Hellish places: Mordor, Charn, the Upside Down, the post-apocalyptic world</li>
<li>The influence of fantastic ur-texts about Hell: Aeneas’s visit in <em>The Aeneid</em>; Dante’s <em>Inferno </em>(and Dorothy L. Sayers’s translation); Marlowe’s <em>Doctor Faustus</em>; Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em>; Jean-Paul Sartre’s <em>No Exit;</em> the art of Hieronymus Bosch; Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em></li>
<li>“This IS the Bad Place!”: The primary world as Hell</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re interested in ANY form of media—text, graphic novels, television, movies, music and music videos, games—as long as it can be described as fantasy and includes a hell or its denizens.</p>
<p>Some texts to consider:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>C.S. Lewis’s <em>The Screwtape Letters </em>and <em>The Great Divorce</em></li>
<li>Charles Williams’s <em>All Hallows’ Eve</em></li>
<li>Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman’s <em>Good Omens</em> (book and television series)</li>
<li>Lois McMaster Bujold’s Five Gods series</li>
<li>Music videos: Lil Nas X’s “Montero” and “Industry Baby”</li>
<li>Television series: <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer,</em> <em>Angel, </em><em>Lovecraft Country</em>, <em>Supernatural, The Good Place, Stranger Things</em></li>
<li><em>Lucifer </em>(graphic novels and television series)</li>
<li>Movies: <em>Get Out, Dogma </em></li>
<li>Tanith Lee’s <em>Tales From the Flat Earth</em> series (<em>Death’s Master</em> et seq.)</li>
<li>Works by Vaclev Havel, Franz Kafka, Nikolai Gogol, George Orwell</li>
<li>Neil Gaiman’s <em>Sandman</em> (graphic novels and television series)</li>
<li>Walter Wangerin, Jr.’s <em>Dun Cow</em> trilogy</li>
<li>Evan Dahm’s <em>Harrowing of Hell </em>(graphic novel)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">Proposals should be approximately 200 words in length and should be sent to both co-chairs.</p>
<p align="center">See you in January! –Erin and Janet</p>
<p> </p>

			<title>[ October 18, 2022 -  October 21, 2022] Conference or similar: International Conference  “Giorgio Agamben. The Urgency of Thought”</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/102294</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p><strong>International Conference </strong></p>
<p><strong>“Giorgio Agamben. The Urgency of Thought”</strong></p>
<p>19-21 October 2022</p>
<p>Universidad de Granada</p>
<p><strong>Keynote speakers: </strong></p>
<p>●      Giorgio Agamben</p>
<p>●      Andrea Cavalletti</p>
<p>●      Pedro G. Romero</p>
<p>●      Germán Labrador</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS</strong></p>
<p>Giorgio Agamben is one of the most influential figures of contemporary critical thought. Widely known for his book series on the obscure sacrificial figure of <em>homo sacer</em>, his works also examine a broad range of problems (biopolitics, aesthetics, literature, postsecularism) from equally varied vantage points (philosophy, law, politics, literary theory) while always retaining a focus on ontology.</p>
<p>The International Conference “Giorgio Agamben. The Urgency of Thought” proposes to analyze the different aspects of Agamben’s oeuvre, from its dialogical relationship with preceding philosophical, aesthetic, and literary work (Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Simone Weil, Guy Debord, Aby Warburg, Gilles Deleuze or Michel Foucault), to its main philological, philosophical, and methodological contributions. Special attention will be paid to new pathways in the praxis inspired by Agamben’s work (<em>Tiqqun</em>). In so doing, the conference shall examine Agamben’s main conceptual contributions to philosophy and political thought, both in the critique of Western apparatuses of power, and in his conceptual proposals (form-of-life, destituent power, the community of whatever singularities). In addition, the conference seeks to explore Agamben’s notions of the politics of literature from his early work to his latest contributions, in which aesthetic and literary thought are imbricated with his philosophical and political concepts. The question of the role of the religious in culture and society will also be analyzed both from this interdisciplinary perspective and from the context of the global escalation of politico-religious conflict and the necessity of reviewing concepts which entail the opening and reappraisal of allegedly secular modern thought.

						<description><p><strong>International Conference </strong></p>
<p><strong>“Giorgio Agamben. The Urgency of Thought”</strong></p>
<p>19-21 October 2022</p>
<p>Universidad de Granada</p>
<p><strong>Keynote speakers: </strong></p>
<p>●      Giorgio Agamben</p>
<p>●      Andrea Cavalletti</p>

<p>●      Germán Labrador</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS</strong></p>
<p>Giorgio Agamben is one of the most influential figures of contemporary critical thought. Widely known for his book series on the obscure sacrificial figure of <em>homo sacer</em>, his works also examine a broad range of problems (biopolitics, aesthetics, literature, postsecularism) from equally varied vantage points (philosophy, law, politics, literary theory) while always retaining a focus on ontology.</p>
<p>The International Conference “Giorgio Agamben. The Urgency of Thought” proposes to analyze the different aspects of Agamben’s oeuvre, from its dialogical relationship with preceding philosophical, aesthetic, and literary work (Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Simone Weil, Guy Debord, Aby Warburg, Gilles Deleuze or Michel Foucault), to its main philological, philosophical, and methodological contributions. Special attention will be paid to new pathways in the praxis inspired by Agamben’s work (<em>Tiqqun</em>). In so doing, the conference shall examine Agamben’s main conceptual contributions to philosophy and political thought, both in the critique of Western apparatuses of power, and in his conceptual proposals (form-of-life, destituent power, the community of whatever singularities). In addition, the conference seeks to explore Agamben’s notions of the politics of literature from his early work to his latest contributions, in which aesthetic and literary thought are imbricated with his philosophical and political concepts. The question of the role of the religious in culture and society will also be analyzed both from this interdisciplinary perspective and from the context of the global escalation of politico-religious conflict and the necessity of reviewing concepts which entail the opening and reappraisal of allegedly secular modern thought. Giorgio Agamben has paid special attention to the tension between religion and (post)secular society, particularly in relation to the question of temporality, capitalism, and art.</p>
<p>Finally, Agamben’s thought has given rise to different criticisms and polemics, from persistent questionings of the usage and extension of some of his concepts and diagnoses to more recent controversies in the wake of his opinions vis-à-vis the biopolitical implications of the current health situation. The conference shall offer an opportunity to measure and assess the position of the latest polemics within the whole of Agamben’s work.</p>
<p>Scholars from all areas of philosophy, literature, political science and religious studies are invited to submit presentation proposals. These may include (but are not limited to) the following topics:</p>
<p>1) The politics of literature.</p>
<p>2) Biopolitics.</p>

			<title>[ November 4, 2022] Talk or similar: Natural goodness, sex, and the perverted faculty argument</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/102290</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Christopher Arroyo (Providence College)<br/><br/><p>There is a longstanding and widely held view, often associated with Catholicism, that intrinsically nonprocreative human sex acts are intrinsically immoral. Some philosophers who hold this view, such as Edward Feser, claim that they can defend the view on purely philosophical grounds by relying on the perverted faculty argument. This paper argues that Feser’s defense of the perverted faculty argument does not work because Feser fails to recognize the full implications of the species-dependence of natural goodness. By drawing on the work of Peter Geach and Philippa Foot, this paper presents a view of natural goodness that adequately accounts for the species-dependence of such goodness. Using this adequate account, the paper argues that at least some intrinsically nonprocreative human sex acts contribute to human flourishing.</p></description>

			<title>[ November 30, 2022] CFP for conference or similar: Workshop on Fanon and Phenomenology</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/102262</link>
						<description><p>The Southern Journal of Philosophy proudly presents: </p>
<p>The 2023 “Workshop Issue” </p>
<p>An annual conference and published proceedings </p>
<p><em>The Southern Journal of Philosophy</em>, in conjunction with The University of Memphis and Wiley Publishing, announces the fourth annual workshop aimed at bringing cutting edge thinking to both classical and contemporary topics, with an eye to encouraging bold new directions in philosophical thought. These workshops combine keynotes and plenary lectures by leading scholars together with competitively selected work. Additionally, 2-4 graduate students are selected in a parallel competition to deliver lighting round talks during the workshop. The main proceedings are published in the lead issue of the subsequent volume of the journal. </p>
<p>The theme of 2019 Workshop was “The Epistemology of Justice” featuring Elizabeth Anderson and Chris Lebron. (2020 interrupted). The 2021 Workshop was “The Ethics of Big Data” featuring Michael Lynch, Josh Fairfield, and David Gunkel. The 2022 Workshop was on the theme of “Early Modern Social Justice,” featuring Susan James and Sam Fleischacker.</p>
<p>The 2023 Workshop will take place on March 31st, with participants spending at least one day and two nights in Memphis (room costs covered). Since, as a workshop, the function of this meeting is a sustained discussion amongst all participants, the expectation is that participants will arrive Thursday evening (March 30th), and depart on Saturday April 1st. Finally, participants commit to submitting final essays for inclusion in the SJP special issue. </p>
<p><strong>The 2023 theme is: “Fanon and Phenomenology” Date: March 31st </strong></p>
<p><strong>Keynote Speakers: Alia Al-Saji and Lewis R. Gordon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Submission deadline: Nov. 30, 2022. Decisions expected by the end of December </strong></p>
<p>Instructions for main program: Selection is based on long-form abstracts. Abstracts should include a title and be between 750-1000 words. They must be prepared for anonymous review with an eye to avoiding unnecessary jargon. Bibliographic material may be placed at the end and does not count toward the word count. A separate document with the author’s name, affiliation, contact information, and paper title should be included with every submission. Email both documents (either as doc. or pdf. files) to the Associate Editor of the SJP, Ms. Cathy Wilhelm, at cwilhelm@memphis.edu. The subject line of this email should read, “2023 SJP Workshop Submission.” </p>
<p>Instructions for graduate student presentations: Follow the same instructions as above, but change subject line of email to read, “2023 SJP Workshop Graduate Submission.” Master and Doctoral students who are currently enrolled in a philosophy graduate program are welcome to apply. Winners will be given 10 minute slots to present 5-minute lighting presentations and field 5 minutes of Q&amp;A. </p>
<p>Note 1: Submission indicates your intention to include final versions of papers in the published proceedings; but acceptance does not guarantee publication. Final work must pass external review. Graduate presentations will be considered for publication as part of the “notes and discussion” category of the journal issue (contributions to “notes and discussion” are four to six thousand words long). </p>
<p>Note 2: The editorial team is not responsible for reviewing abstracts for proper preparation. Submissions which are not properly anonymized or formatted may be rejected without notice. </p>
<p>Note 3: Additional travel support may become available. Winners will be notified as needed. However, we do not expect to be able to fund additional travel costs of graduate winners beyond room and banquet. </p>
<p>Direct inquiries to SJP organizer Michael Monahan at mjmnahan@memphis.edu.</p></description>

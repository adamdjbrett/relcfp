						<description><p>The development of natural language models gives an opportunity to use AI-chatbots in religious discourse analysis, as well as to test them as possible theologians.</p>
<p>Many practical and philosophical questions arise on these grounds. Let us list out only a few of them. Are such chatbots really helpful in those analyses? Can they be really good logicians (if they don't "know" when they say true sentences) and good theologians (if they are not humans)? Can we train a model to make it operating like Thomas Aquinas (or at least some of his disciples)?</p>
<p>At this workshop we will collect results of such experiments which include <u>both theological and logical</u> perspective.</p>
<p>Topics may include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>testing theological and logical skills of AI-chatbots,</li>
<li>comparison of different AI-chatbots/AI-models with respect to such logical and theological skills,</li>

Following their lead, scholars in the past two decades have charted how <em>Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum </em>navigates intricate issues of gender, genre, patronage, courtly politics, religion, and poetic authority. This panel aims to expand this fruitful work by exploring new avenues for scholarship that consider Lanyer’s engagement with other contexts and discourses. Accordingly, this panel seeks papers that either examine new courses of inquiry or reevaluate established topics of Lanyer scholarship. Paper topics might include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embodiment or Humoralism</li>
<li>Sensation or Sensorium</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Ecology or Nature</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Classical Reception</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper title (15 words maximum)</li>
<li>Abstract (200 words maximum)</li>
<li>Brief CV (1 page maximum)</li>
<li>PhD or other terminal degree completion year (past or expected)</li>
<li>Full name, current affiliation, and e-mail address</li>

			<title>[ June 23, 2023] Conference or similar: A.I. Aesthetics (III)</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/111734</link>
						<description>Venue: Campo Grande, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa<br/><br/><p><strong>Research Workshop Series <em>A.I. Aesthetics &amp; Philosophy of Technology</em> org. by Alexander Gerner</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.I. Aesthetics III</strong></p>
<p><strong>23.6.2023 hybrid event</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>23/06/2023</strong></p>
<p>FCUL (Universidade de Lisboa) &amp; online</p>
<p><strong>11-18h</strong></p>
<p>A.I. Aesthetics III Workshop <em>org. </em><em>Alexander Gerner, Renata Silva Souza, Vinicius de Aguiar</em><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>"And even if we did succeed in doing so, it would still remain true, that the machine would remain utterly devoid of original initiative and would only do the special kind of thing it had been calculated to do. This, however, is no defect in a machine; we do not want it to do its own business, but ours." C.S. Peirce Logical Machines (1887)</em></p>
<p>*<strong></strong></p>

<p>The study of computational aesthetics in the combination of computer science and A.I. examines how machines can assess aesthetics or display creativity or mimic aesthetic behavior. This field does not require artificial consciousness but instead relies on stochastics, algorithms and models that can imitate human aesthetic judgments or generateaesthetic outputs that might be judged by humans as aesthetically valuable. A.I. utopias envision a future where machine learning agential systemsare not only tools engaged for efficiency, convenience, substitution of work or programmed profit but as well as explorations of the aesthetic and the sensible and intervene into our social common.</p>
<p>Still, AI systems might be proposed as a means for promoting the common good, public interest, fostering green transition, and even human values that underlie our diverse societies and ecosystems. What consequences do diverse forms of A.I. aesthetics, social-ethical and political participation in algorithmic society entail today? What <em>praxeology of humanities </em>must engage us concerning increasingly ubiquitous, intimate, affective calculations, computation and design by machine learning, and the cybernetic formalizations of human cultural techniques such as language, among others, for safeguarding our common futures?</p>
<p>In the early days of computer-generated art (Jones et al. 2023) from the 1950s onwards the works of computer art pioneers were influenced by <em>mathematics, geometry, physics, </em><em>combinatorial writing, </em><em>and music</em>, as well as by <em>abstract art movements</em> such as <em>constructivism</em> and <em>op art</em>. They were often experimental, exploratory, and <em>playful</em>, as the artists discovered new <em>possibilities and limitations of the machines and their </em><em>co-</em><em>creativity</em>, which reflected the social and <strong>cultural changes brought by the</strong> <strong><em>computerization of society</em></strong>. As computer technology evolved, artists began to use algorithms and other mathematical rules to create art- often to the <em>detriment of the materiality(Nake 2010:60)</em> aspect of the work. However, the value of the works was always debated, as early works were often seen as aesthetic design rather than art as it was frequently "<em>biased toward attracting the attention of our brain's most basic pattern-recognition </em>skills"(Barrow, 1995 cit.in: Taylor(2004:148)<em> </em>lacking artistic "<em>resonance."</em></p>
<p><em>We want to investigate the following questions among others:</em></p>
<p><em>Do </em><em>A.I. </em><em>generations</em><em> enhance </em><em>aesthetic indeterminacy</em><em></em><em>(</em><em>Zeilinger</em><em></em><em>2023) by enabling </em><em>social scaffolding, diagrammatic reasoning, abduction, </em><em>human </em><em>Learning, </em><em>and development,</em><em> and contribute substantially to the UNESCO 2030 development goals?</em></p>
<p><em>How is democratic participation changed by A.I.Aesthetics?</em></p>
<p><em>Does </em><em>AI-generated art serve the interests of </em><em>powerful digital platforms </em><em>that exploit users' data and </em><em>historical works and </em><em>labor by using A.I. as a marketing</em><em>, influencer, and manipulation</em><em> tool or a surveillance device that collects personal information and preferences</em><em>?</em><em></em><em>  </em></p>
<p><em>Is A.I. aesthetics praxis diminishing the reality index in which mean/demeaning images (Steyerl 2023) feed on latent spaces of exchange value, use value and commodity (cf. Adorno), critically assessed as based on a wrong idea of intelligence that could be designated dependently its perspective, "uncreative intelligence" (Mersch), "Artificial idiocy" (Zizek), “dumb meaning” (Bajohr 2022), or a satisficing (Hubert Simon) "cliché-generator"?</em></p>
<p><em>How does A.I. Aesthetics relate to society?</em></p>
<p><em>How did A.I. aesthetics co-evolve, mix, change and differ from other computer art and electronic arts, game aesthetics, beginning and aesthetic developments?</em></p>
<p><em>Are the new A.I. tools living up to their metaphors such as machine "hallucinations" or "dreams" (DeepDream) or even "windows into alternate realities in the latent space" (Emad Mostaque, Twitter, 7/3/2023)?</em></p>
<p><em>How A.I. aesthetics is related to social scaffolding, diagrammatic reasoning, abduction, </em><em>human </em><em>Learning?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>How can we reach out fr</em></strong><strong><em>om Style</em></strong><strong><em> transfer</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>of A.I. remakes/remixes to</em></strong><strong><em> societal vision transfer?</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><em></em></p>
<p><em>How is </em><em>Governance of A.I. through democratic processes</em><em> and AI aesthetics</em><em> </em><em>strengthened or weakened?</em></p>
<p><em>What role does A.I. aesthetics play in architecture, urban planning, green, digital transition</em><em>s</em><em>,</em><em> and questions of the digital-sensible divide</em><em>?</em></p>
<p>We ask participants interested in Participationin this third collaborative and interdisciplinary workshop on A.I. Aesthetics to contribute with a shortintervention/presentation (of up to 20min). You are invited to send a brief max 300-500 word research statement, a title,</p>

			<title>Belief in Solidarity. Interdisciplinary perspectives on the role of religiously inspired solidarity in modernizing and post-secular contexts</title>

We proceed from the observation that religiously inspired or faith-based organizations have played and continue to play a significant role in offering social support and protection to vulnerable groups. However, these organizations do not sit easily in their intellectual and political-ideological context. While religiously inspired solidarity is driven by inner motives and personal faith, in the historical development of European welfare states, solidarity has become institutionalized as a set of impersonal redistributive mechanisms such as paying taxes and social contributions . Relatedly, solidarity practices based on faith and religion can come into conflict with the political-philosophical standards and values of modern welfare regimes. Within the territorial context of nation states and against the backdrop of nation states conceived as ‘imagined communities’, access to social services is based on the idea of social rights, justice and equality and conditional on neutral criteria related to citizenship. While faith-based forms of solidarity can potentially lead to less calculated, more disinterested and less reciprocal forms of solidarity, they are often perceived as being at odds with what we call ‘modernity’. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The aim of our workshop is to unpack this tension in an interdisciplinary way. Both in the past and today the practices and views of religiously inspired people were both challenged by and related to the development of such ‘modern’ concepts and standards as equality, neutrality, human rights and democracy. This urges us to confront empirical insights from history and sociology with the normative views of political philosophy. We expect the presentations to concentrate on the historical and present-day <i>interaction </i>between, on one hand, religiously inspired and faith-based practices of solidarity and, on the other, the secular and modernizing context and the development of (European) welfare regimes. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Our workshop hopes to contribute to ‘de-naturalizing’ the dominant conceptions of solidarity and to transcending the taken-for-granted binary of secular versus religious. Thematically, we will contribute to discussions about the ‘post-secular’ condition, the strengths and weaknesses of the (European) welfare state, and the role of civil society and grassroots organizations in it. We also welcome comparative contributions from non-European contexts and/or on religious institutionalization. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><b><span><span><span>Possible research questions:</span></span></span></b></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>- Were/are faith-based acts of solidarity driven by a spiritual (and borderless) ‘love of neighbour’ or not, and what does this imply for the relations between giver and receiver? How was/is the relevant community conceived, how did that differ from and/or interact with the territorial and rights-based logic of the welfare state? In which practices of inclusion and exclusion does/did it result? </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>- How do/did faith-based forms of solidarity interact with the ‘modernizing’ context? Were/are the former more based on paternalistic relationships, as is often argued from an historical point of view? Did/do the organizations have proselytizing goals, and did/do they perhaps exclude non-believers? If so, how did/does this square with such notions as emancipation and empowerment or ideas such as fairness and justice?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><b><span><span><span>Themes parallel paper sessions:</span></span></span></b></span></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Definitions of solidarity and community</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Faith-based and religiously inspired practices of solidarity are rooted in different conceptions of solidarity.

Believers are increasingly less concerned with institutional frameworks and the strict boundaries of denominations. At the same time, the globalizing context seems to reveal more and more similarities between different religious backgrounds, if only because they all position themselves against the secular ‘other’. This session explores how this development translates into attitudes and practices related to solidarity. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><b><span><span><span>Confirmed Keynote Speakers: </span></span></span></b></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Sigrun Kahl, Assistant Professor of Political Science and Sociology, Yale University; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Anne Birgitta Pessi, Professor of Church and Social Studies, University of Helsinki; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Joan Stavo-Debauge, Associate Researcher, University of Lausanne.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><b><span><span><span>Practical information </span></span></span></b></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Organizer: </span></span></span><span><span><span>University of Antwerp (Urban Studies Institute) and UCSIA (</span></span></span><span><span><span>University Centre Saint-Ignatius Antwerp), Belgium </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Location: University of Antwerp, City Campus – Hof van Liere, Prinsstraat 13, Antwerp, Belgium </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Date: 11 – 13 December 2023 </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Application procedure: To submit your application, fill in the online submission form and upload the following documents:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><ul><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>the abstract (750 - 1.000 words including references, in English) of your proposed paper; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>your curriculum vitae, in English, list of publications included (if available). </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Deadline: 28 June 2023</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Notice of acceptance: 14 July 2023</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Applicants should:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>be a junior or a senior scholar involved in ongoing academic research relevant to the themes addressed in the sessions of the workshop;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Blind peer-review: The selection of participants will be made on a competitive basis by the members of the organizing scientific committee consisting of Bert De Munck (University of Antwerp), Erik De Bom (UCSIA), Gilke Gunst (UCSIA), Patrick Loobuyck (University of Antwerp), Stijn Oosterlynck (University of Antwerp), Barbara Segaert (UCSIA), Michiel Van Dam (University of Antwerp) and Kaat Wils (KU Leuven).

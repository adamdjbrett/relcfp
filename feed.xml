						<description>Publication Name: Finding Our Place in the Digital World: Philosophical Essays on Technology, Phenomenology, and the Environment<br/><br/><p>Edited by Ian Werkheiser and Michael Butler</p>
<p>We invite proposals for chapters in an edited volume to be published by Springer Publishing entitled “Finding Our Place in the Digital World: Philosophical Essays on Technology, Phenomenology, and the Environment.” The volume seeks to establish the philosophy of the digital world as a unified subdiscipline at the intersection of the philosophy of technology, phenomenology, and environmental philosophy. </p>
<p><br/> Bringing together scholars working from different philosophical perspectives, this book examines everyday interactions with emerging digital technologies and the changes to our lived worlds to which they give rise. Issues discussed will include: how the concept of world and environment are shaped by technology; social justice and political issues that come out of those changes; interpersonal relationships and self-understanding in a digital world; knowing and cognition with an extended or diminished mind; what it’s like to appreciate and interpret these new mixed worlds; and the alteration of human capacities and skills through a transformation of the landscape of affordances.</p>
<p><br/> This book is not only interested in applying pre-existing philosophical frameworks to new questions, however. The editors are also interested in how thinking through these new technologies causes us to reexamine issues in philosophy. For example, too often environmental philosophy neglects the built environment, and in particular non-physical, virtual elements of the environment, despite these playing an increasingly important role in people’s lives. Likewise, phenomenology and embodied cognition literature sometimes applies itself to analyses of particular technologies or tools, however we are interested in how the emergence of the digital world changes our fundamental notions of the self, the subject and the various categories of cognition and perceptual life investigated by phenomenology. </p>
<p><br/> Accepted authors will be invited to an in-person workshop at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in early 2025 to present and get feedback on chapter drafts. That event is sponsored by the Society for Philosophy and Technology</p>
<p><br/> To Submit: send a brief chapter proposal (500-1000 words) and brief author biography (100-300 words) to digitalworldsworkshop@gmail.com</p>
<p><br/> Timeline: </p>
<p><strong>Proposals due September 1, 2024</strong></p>
<p>Chapter drafts due January 15, 2025</p>
<p>Final Chapters due June 15, 2025</p></description>

			<title>[ October 7, 2024 -  October 8, 2024] Conference or similar: Resisting the Divides: Contemporary Philosophy of Art</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/122674</link>
						<description>Venue: 2900 Bedford Ave. <br/><br/><p>The philosophy of art, as practiced in the western world, has tended to have two divided homes: in analytic philosophy and continental philosophy. Within the analytic tradition, the philosophy of art has recently undergone a revival with the emphasis on perception. This has more closely aligned art theory to science and questions of biology as well as to issues within psychology. The continental tradition has traditionally drawn upon phenomenology’s first-person experience with its ties to embodied perception as well as the social and historical concerns of the social aspect of art. In the realm itself of visual art, the state of (so-called) post-post modernism has resulted in both the dissolution of belief in progress and even, according to some art critics, a lamentable stagnation. But many philosophers of the last century, beginning with Walter Benjamin, Adorno, Nelson Goodman, etc., have suggested that art needs to be thought of within its social, pragmatic, or epistemological functions, suggesting perhaps a need to think of art outside the confines of modernism’s stylistic revolutions and formalist issues. Relatedly, the pluralism within science could be accessed as model for this enterprise. Multiple views on a phenomenon are required due to the complexity of the enterprise, and the practice of both making art and of perceiving it might be in that category. This conference seeks to bring these strands, the analytical and the continental ones, together and evaluate how to move forward with art theory in an age of globalization.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions on these possible questions:</p>
<p>1.     Should we value a diversity of perspectives in art theory? If so, what is the value? If not, why not?</p>
<p>2.     Are there aspects of art that we presume to be universal that are, in fact, culturally situated? </p>
<p>3.     How should different ways of experiencing art be characterized?</p>
<p>4.     What is the epistemological function of art?</p>
<p>5.     How does the monetary role in art affect both the artist and the perceiver of art?</p>
<p>6.     How do the mechanics of seeing (e.g., gist perception, peripheral vision, etc.) affect how we experience art?</p>

<p>Religious Communities in the Virtual Age:</p>
<p>Practices, Values, Technologies, Boundaries</p>
<p>28 October 2024, Manchester, England</p>
<p>Keynote Speaker: Prof Linda Woodhead, King’s College London.</p>
<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, religious communities across Europe and the world have engaged with the</p>
<p>digital world and specific digital technologies in a wide variety of ways. Some have embraced online</p>
<p>worship and gathering as a tool for widening or enriching a sense of community. Others have used social</p>
<p>media to re-think the boundaries of their work with their wider society around them or to connect with</p>
<p>their co-religionists across the world. Still others have consciously avoided digital tools, seeing a spiritual</p>
<p>and social potency in in-person gathering that cannot be replicated. But nearly all have had to face the new</p>
<p>assumptions and practices of the virtual age that the pandemic made far more universal than they were</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>How have these engagements with the technologies, practices and norms of the virtual age changed the</p>
<p>lives of religious communities? How has it affected their sense of community, their understanding of the</p>
<p>borders of membership, or their relationship with the wider world? What has it meant for the means and</p>
<p>potencies of collective worship? How has it changed patterns of authority and decision making? How have</p>
<p>notions of sacred place and time been affected by the virtual? How do communities navigate notions of</p>
<p>‘appropriate’ or ‘genuine’ in the context of the digital society?</p>
<p>This conference will bring together scholars investigating these questions in a range of religious</p>
<p>communities, from large and dominant ones to established minorities and marginalised or immigrant</p>
<p>groups, and from a range of national contexts. It centres around the work of the EU-CHANSE funded</p>
<p>project Religious Communities in the Virtual Age (recovira.org), but welcomes other scholars in dialogue</p>
<p>with these concerns from fields such as the study of religion, sociology, theology, performance,</p>
<p>anthropology, cultural studies and so on. While the focus is on the lives of religious communities in the</p>
<p>post-pandemic era and papers are necessarily limited to 10-15 minutes, we are interested in case studies,</p>
<p>comparative, and theoretical approaches.</p>
<p>Please note: This conference will take place in central Manchester. Conference fees, which will include a</p>
<p>catered lunch, will be kept to a minimum (under £20). In-person attendance will be limited by the size of</p>
<p>the venue. While offsite, online presentation will not be possible for this conference, it will be streamed for</p>
<p>those who wish to watch. Online viewing will require pre-booking, which will be free.</p>
<p>Abstract submissions are due 10th May 2024</p>
<p>We hope to notify applicants by 31st May 2024</p>
<p>Please submit abstracts via this form: <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/ppidGy9jUr">https://forms.office.com/e/ppidGy9jUr</a></p>
<p>With any questions, please contact the project team at <a href="mailto:recovira@mmu.ac.uk">recovira@mmu.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>This conference is sponsored by the Performance Research Group, Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>

Clarence Rivers, the “father of Black Catholic liturgy,” and the 40th anniversary of the Black Bishops of the United States’ pastoral letter, “What We Have Seen and Heard.” In addition to keynote addresses and workshops inspired by Fr. Rivers and “What We Have Seen and Heard,” we will also have opportunities to gather for song and prayer in the traditions of soulful worship called for by Fr. Rivers and “What We Have Seen and Heard.” The symposium will take place Friday and Saturday at Curran Place on the University of Dayton campus, and the weekend’s events will culminate in Sunday Eucharist at 11:00am ET on November 24 at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Peter in Chains in Cincinnati, with Wilton Cardinal Gregory, the first African American Catholic cardinal, presiding and preaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fr. Rivers’ work in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and beyond tore down walls of racial exclusion and placed the American Church on a path toward acceptance of all its members—a path we continue to walk, often with faltering steps. To honor Rivers’ legacy, to heed the call of “What We Have Seen and Heard” encouraging our pilgrimage toward greater unity, and in the Akan spirit of “sankofa” (learning from the past as we move into the future), the Office of African American Pastoral Ministries, partnering with the University of Dayton, has prepared a series of events to commemorate these important anniversaries in November 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keynote speakers for the events include Dr. Kim Harris, Bishop Edward K. Braxton, Dr. Joseph Brown, SJ, and Wilton Cardinal Gregory. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Proposals:</p>
<p dir="ltr">In-person presenters are sought for the Symposium at University of Dayton who will:</p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Engage Symposium participants in active learning and reflection on these themes (workshops or presentations are sought, rather than papers);</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">

			<title>[ May 1, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Bergson: Translating Duration (PAMLA special session)</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/122502</link>
						<description><p>In accordance with the conference theme, “Translation in Action,” the work of French philosopher Henri Bergson is more than relevant. Bergson’s work was written in French and translations are often offered with notes about the richness of his words and potential loss of meaning. Questions of translation surround and even permeate Bergson philosophy.</p>
<p>Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927 “in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented,” Bergson drew on descriptive and visual models to demonstrate complex ideas. He was a pioneering philosopher showing interest in film, utilizing the flow of moving images to explain concepts of memory and relativity. Questions of translation surround and even permeate Bergson philosophy.</p>
<p>In addition to the questions related to translating Bergson’s French into other languages, on a deeper and more complex layer, there are questions of translating the inner experience of consciousness, the “ineffable” immediate feeling involved in each moment as having a singularly unique nuance. Bergson's point is clear in the case of the peculiarity of each <em>sui generis </em>effort and idea of an artist. No less rich is every moment of our own inner life, even if we lack the words to express it, or the attentiveness to appreciate it. As poet Paul Valery said, "The most powerful and unprecedented images and metaphors obeyed [Bergson's] desire to reconstruct, in the consciousness of others, the discoveries he made in his own, and the results of his internal experiments." Bergson makes translation a fundamental goal of all philosophy, even when communicating in one's own language.</p>
<p>This session invites papers that explore the many facets of Bergson’s philosophy especially those related to the conference theme.</p>

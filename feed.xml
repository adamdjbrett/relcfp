			<title>[ September 28, 2023 -  September 30, 2023] Conference or similar: Eco-phenomenology and Passivity</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107309</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p><strong>Eco-Phenomenology and Passivity Conference</strong></p>
<p><strong>Call for Papers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Place: UiT – The Arctic University of Norway (Tromsø)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dates: 28-30 September 2023</strong></p>
<p>Phenomenology is a tradition of thinking that acknowledges the already-givenness of our bodies, our relationships to others, and the ecosystems in which we live. Since the founding of the field in the early twentieth century, phenomenologists have taken an interest in the ways that humans engage the world that precedes us, but it was only in the last twenty years that scholars recognized the potential phenomenology could have for environmental ethics and the ongoing multi-disciplinary rethinking of our human relationship to the more-than-human world. Since then, scholars approaching environmental ethics from within philosophy, literature, theology, anthropology, and cognitive science have drawn consistently on the vocabulary and methodologies of phenomenology to approach questions of: how we understand and can better anticipate human impacts on ecosystems; what it means to dwell/be at home in a specific ecosystem; what role the perception of animals plays in individual and community environmental impact; and how human embodiment can be reconceived as dependent on the natural world that exceeds us. Related to this are questions of cultural ways of being toward nature that undermine the assumption of human dominance.</p>
<p>Building on prior work on the phenomenology of embodiment, subjectivity, ethics, and most recently passivity, this conference consolidates contemporary thinking on the phenomenology of passivity and environmental ethics. Passivity is a key concept in phenomenology. By passivity, we refer to all the ways in which we receive and are conditioned by the surrounding world prior to active attempts to master it. Thus far, passivity´s relevance to environmental philosophy and ethics has been obscured by a focus on environmental activism. Indeed, from an activist perspective, passivity tends to be understood as a “do-nothing” attitude that will lead to environmental disaster. Rather than defining passivity in opposition to activism, participants in this conference will explore passivity as linked to givenness, inter-dependence and environmental response-ability, conceived of in relation to the present generation´s need to respond to prior human damage to the earth, natural forces beyond our control, and the anticipated needs of multi-species future.</p>
<p>Ted Toadvine, Arne Johan Vetlesen, Michael Marder and Simone Kotva will give keynote presentations. We welcome proposals for additional presentations of around 20 minutes each.</p>
<p>Please send abstracts of 300-400 words to Cassandra.falke@uit.no by March 15th 2023. Emails regarding acceptance will be sent by April 15th.</p></description>

As a result, scholarship has primarily focused on the rabbinic elite represented in and responsible for the Talmud. However, hundreds of Jewish magical amulets written on bowls provide access to the unknown lives and practices of Jews in the very cities in which the Babylonian rabbis flourished. These magical texts may serve as a rare vantage point from which to reconstruct the social and cultural history of Jews in the Sasanian empire. This lecture will focus on slavery and enslaved individuals in the Sasanian empire through their appearance in the Aramaic incantation bowl texts. In addition, the speaker will point to evidence that connects slaves with the demonic in the magic bowls and in other magical sources, through texts and in imagery.</p><p>Dr. Avigail Manekin-Bamberger is a senior lecturer in the Department of Jewish History and Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Her research focuses on the social and cultural history of Jews in antiquity, with a special emphasis on Jewish society in the Sasanian Empire and ancient Jewish magic.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>UCL Institute of Jewish Studies</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ijs@ucl.ac.uk">ijs@ucl.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/511680358727" target="_blank">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/511680358727</a></div></div></div></description>

<p data-adtags-visited="true">Edited by Scott Donahue-Martens and Brandon Simonson</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) that was created in 1974 and popularized in the 1970’s and 1980’s, though it has found a renaissance in contemporary popular culture due in part to its prominent role in the Netflix series Stranger Things. The COVID-19 pandemic saw a surge in virtual Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) gaming via work-from-home platforms such as Zoom; from their living rooms, people across the world would work in the virtual office by day and venture into the fantasy worlds of D&amp;D by evening. Additionally, the rising popularity of live-streamers and groups with enormous followings, such as Critical Role, underscores the prominent role that the game continues to hold with tabletop gamers and speaks to the diverse manners in which D&amp;D is enjoyed.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">The fantasy worlds of D&amp;D are replete with religious imagery and rely on the theological imagination. Real-world theological and religious concepts and ideas inform this theological imagination, placing human players in foreign yet familiar settings. Guidebooks provide source material for religious and belief structures, as well as deities and player classes that engage both religion and theology. D&amp;D utilizes theology and religion in its expansive mythos, worldbuilding, and everyday experiences of adventures.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">The editors gladly invite submissions on, but not limited to, the topics below for a volume on the intersections of academic disciplines of theology, religious studies, and the creative world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D), to be published in the Theology, Religion, and Popular Culture book series. Interested authors should send chapter abstracts of 300-700 words, along with a CV or resume, to <a href="mailto:theology.religion.dnd@gmail.com">theology.religion.dnd@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p data-adtags-visited="true">The call for chapters ends February 15, 2023. Authors will be notified of accepted proposals on March 1st, 2023. Authors will submit their accepted chapters by August 31st, 2023. Final chapters with revisions will be due March 1st, 2024 with an anticipated publication date honoring the upcoming 50thanniversary of D&amp;D.</p>
<p data-adtags-width="494" data-adtags-visited="true">The editors ask that all contributors engage with the existing academic literature on D&amp;D. While the editors will not prescribe particular sources or methodologies, proposals should reflect acquaintance with current scholarship on D&amp;D and final drafts are expected to engage with this scholarship. In other words, we expect each chapter to critically engage D&amp;D along with other scholars.</p>

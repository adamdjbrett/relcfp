						<description>Publication Name: Deleuze and the Schizoanalysis of Performance<br/><br/><p><strong>Call for submissions – deadline extended…</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Deleuze and the Schizoanalysis of Performance</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Schizoanalytic Applications Series, Bloomsbury Press.</p>

<p>Since the publication of <em>Deleuze and Performance </em>(2009), Deleuze’s philosophy has inspired a number of vital interventions in the fields of performance and theatre studies. Deleuze’s thought has also played an important role in the emergence of Performance Philosophy and continues to energise theory and practice across a range of disciplinary and vocational boundaries. </p>

<p>However, relatively little research has taken an explicitly schizoanalytic approach to performance. While many of the key conceptual tools of schizoanalysis recur across the literature (the assemblage; the BwO; the abstract machine etc.), the question of whether schizoanalysis might provide a framework for analysing and creating performance has only been infrequently asked. Given the difficulty of trying to extract a schizoanalytic method from Deleuze and Guattari’s writing – and the continuing need for schizoanalysis to be more carefully addressed in the field of Deleuze studies – this is not surprising. But it does point towards two possibilities: that schizoanalysis might provide resources for creating new ways of thinking, feeling, and doing performance; and that performance might contribute to the development of new schizoanalytic methods and practices.  </p>

<p>This volume aims to pursue these possibilities. Bringing together research in Deleuze and Guattari studies, performance and theatre studies, Performance Philosophy and beyond, scholars are invited to explore a range of questions. What does a schizoanalytic theatre or performance criticism look like? Could the materialist psychiatry of <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> – and particularly an understanding of desiring-production as a ‘universal primary process’ – reshape our understanding of performance as a social and historical practice? And how do problems that are central to performance – such as ‘liveness’, participation, presence, the performing body etc. – test the schizoanalytic categories that Deleuze and Guattari most frequently deploy with reference to literary examples? How might a schizoanalytic framework operate in an applied theatre setting and what can applied theatre practices contribute to our understanding of schizoanalysis, particularly given its involvement in questions of mental health and wellbeing? In what ways can performance make legible and resist the fascism of the present? How can contemporary work in new materialism, affect theory, theatre ecologies and Performance Philosophy contribute to the emergence of a performance schizoanalysis? And what concepts will invent themselves once schizoanalysis and performance are brought together? </p>

<p><strong>Submissions:</strong></p>

<p>Scholars and practitioners are invited to propose chapters that respond to these questions (but should not feel limited by them). Abstracts should be between 400-700 words, accompanied by a short bio and affiliation, and sent to <a href="mailto:daniel.koczy@newcastle.ac.uk">daniel.koczy@newcastle.ac.uk</a> before 07/8/23. Final articles will be between 7000-10000 words, including footnotes and citations. </p></description>

The June issue of <em>AEH</em> is also the first to include “Engaged History,” a new feature examining ways Anglican and Episcopal communities are encountering once buried history.</p><p>Prayer book studies include:</p><ul><li> “Remembering Our Baptism: Memoir of a Continuing Project” by <strong>William H. Petersen</strong>. The emeritus dean of Bexley Hall Seminary examines the “sea-change” related to the liturgy and theology of Baptism that occurred between 1949 and 1979 while pondering ways lessons learned during earlier eras of liturgical renewal might influence work today.</li><li><strong>Sylvia A. Sweeney</strong>, contributing editor of this issue is also professor of liturgics and homiletics at Bloy House in Los Angeles. She explores the understudied role of second wave feminism during development and ratification of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer in an essay titled “The Role of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century Women’s Movement in Liturgical Renewal in the Episcopal Church.”</li><li><strong>Juan M.C. Oliver</strong>, Custodian of the Book of Common Prayer between 2015 and 2022, outlines challenges Anglicans face and suggests standards to consider when translating liturgical materials in “Liturgical Translations in the Episcopal Church.”</li><li>“The History of Liturgical Revision in the Church of England and Its Implications for The Episcopal Church” by <strong>Shawn Strout</strong>, assistant professor of worship and associate dean of chapel at Virginia Theological Seminary, contextualizes ways proposed changes to redefine the prayer book in Article X of the Constitution of the Episcopal Church mirrors earlier moves in the Church of England.</li><li>The final study offers 8 guiding principles to counter anti-Judaism in liturgy and worship. The essay titled “Talking About Jews: Principles, Problems, and Proposals for Prayer Book Revision” is written by <strong>Daniel Joslyn-Siemiatkoski</strong>, an Episcopal priest and the Kraft Family Professor and Director of the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning at Boston College.</li></ul><p>In addition to these 5 peer-reviewed essays, church reviews take readers to a Sunday worship service at St. Paul’s, Clifton, in the Church of England’s Diocese of Bristol and to an ecumenical retreat of Lutherans, Anglicans, and Roman Catholics in northern Michigan.</p><p>This issue of <em>AEH</em> launches the journal’s new “engaged history” feature. Engaged History refers to collaborative projects undertaken by Anglican and Episcopal institutions that confront buried historical narratives. <strong>Robert Black</strong> illustrates ways St. Luke’s Episcopal Parish in Salisbury, North Carolina, has engaged with the legacy of race and racism as a barrier to Christian mission. This includes commissioning a new Pentecost icon to better illustrate the Beloved Community “…as it includes people of different shapes, sizes, ages, genders, races, and abilities all gathered around a table and receiving the gift of the Spirit.”</p><p>As always, readers enjoy a treasure trove of book reviews related to church history and Anglican scholarship, including:</p><ul><li><em>Privilege and Prophecy: Social Activism in the Post War Episcopal Church</em> by Robert Tobin | Reviewed by John L. Kater of Church Divinity School of the Pacific</li><li><em>The Book of Common Prayer: A Guide</em> by Charles Hefling | Reviewed by Sean Otto of the Anglican Diocese of Quebec</li><li><em>Mother Earth, Postcolonial and Liberation Theologies</em> edited by Sophia Chirongoma and Esther Mombo | Reviewed by Carla E. Roland Guzmán of General Theological Seminary</li><li><em>Iris Murdoch and Others: A Writer in Dialogue with Theology</em> by Paul S. Fiddes | Reviewed by Molly James of The Episcopal Church Center</li></ul><p><em>Anglican and Episcopal History</em> is published quarterly in March, June, September, and December.

Can the hadith<i> </i>prove to be a reliable source for historical inquiry into the 7<sup>th</sup> century, despite its codification in the 9<sup>th</sup> century? And, if so, can other genres of hadith convey insights that contradict or confirm the <i>tafsīr </i>tradition? How might different methodological approaches to the hadith<i> </i>and improved analytical techniques shed new light on the Qurʾan and its environment? And how is the hadith, if at all,<i> </i>a witness to the existence of and the specific cultural and religious impact of Jewish, Christian, or other communities in Arabia? </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>While we are particularly interested in scholarly contributions that engage with the preceding questions, we welcome other avenues of inquiry into the hadith, Islamic late antiquity, and the interaction of Jews, Christians, and (other) Arabian peoples in and around the 7<sup>th</sup> century CE. By way of example, themes to be addressed include:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>1. </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Methodological approaches to the study of Muslim traditions: hadith, <i>tafsīr</i>, and <i>akhbār</i></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>2.

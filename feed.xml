From descriptions of heaven, hell, and purgatory to explorations of reincarnation and mythical spaces like Hades and the Elysian fields, medieval thinkers utilized art, music, literature, and theology to imagine different forms of life after death. In turn, such texts shaped what the afterlife looked like, sounded like, and felt like. With every work of writing and art, the afterlives depicted in classical literature and scripture took on slightly or drastically different forms. This session seeks to delve into the medieval construction of the afterlife, examining how life after death was depicted, interpreted, and experienced in medieval culture, both within and beyond Europe. We invite proposals that examine the crafting of heaven, hell, and other unearthly spaces and especially encourage papers that consider multiple or interdisciplinary texts.</p>
<p> We welcome papers that explore, but are not limited to, the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literary and dramatic representations of the afterlife </li>
<li>Theological and philosophical discussions of the afterlife</li>
<li>The afterlife in art, music, and visual culture </li>
<li>Depictions of Edenic or paradisiacal spaces </li>
<li>Depictions of the afterlife and paradise in travel literature</li>
<li>Secular explorations of life after death</li>
<li>Classical and renaissance reception</li>
<li>Discussions of transcendence </li>
<li>Contemptus mundi texts </li>
<li>Saints’ lives and visions </li>
<li>Devotional texts </li>
<li>Liturgy and the afterlife </li>
<li>Medieval soteriology and exegesis </li>
</ul>

Religion is an essential part of this story. Christian doctrine was the lens through which European explorers, colonizers, and slaveholders understood somatic and cultural difference and, subsequently, the means by which they justified their violent and extractive practices, including the institution of slavery. At the same time, indigenous Americans and Afro-descended people were converting (willingly or otherwise) to Christianity, and, as various scholars have demonstrated, using the principles of spiritual equality and universal Christendom to push back against their subjugation.  In this roundtable, we will turn our attention to the specific means by which Christian doctrine contributed to the creation and reification of racial categories. How were Biblical accounts deployed to describe and interpret human difference? How did theological approaches to human difference manifest in art and literature, devotional or otherwise? How did confessionalisation contribute to the fashioning of national racial identities? In additional to offering an opportunity to take stock of the state of the field and discuss work-in-progress, this roundtable will make space for collaborative reflections on future directions for the field.  Proposals are welcomed from researchers actively engaged in exploring these and related questions. The sponsoring organisation, Medicine and the Making of Race (mmor.co.uk), is able to cover conference registration and RSA membership fees. Please send a CV (max. 2 pages) and a brief outline of your relevant research and/or publications to Eli Cumings (<a href="mailto:eli.cumings@kcl.ac.uk">eli.cumings@kcl.ac.uk</a>) by August 7, 2023. Questions can also be directed to this email address. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p><strong>Session Abstract: </strong>How does our understanding of religion in the Romantic era shape our interpretation and evaluation of Romantic thought and literature? How might we reconsider Romantic literature within the contexts of religious surplus in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries?</p>
<p>In his Natural Supernaturalism (1971), M. H. Abrams had identified the moment of Romanticism as “a decisive turn in Western culture,” a turn that assimilated and reinterpreted “religious ideas, as constitutive elements in a world view founded on secular premises” (13-14). More recently, the study of Romanticism and religion has reached a critical juncture, as recent scholars have introduced new ways of thinking about concepts of “religion” and “secularism.”</p>
<p>Hoping to further or challenge these explorations, this panel is an invitation to an interdisciplinary conversation that might go in a number of directions. Proposals (of roughly 300 words, accompanied by a short vita) on British, American, and continental Romanticisms are welcome. Possible topics could include, but are by no means limited to, areas of inquiry such as:</p>
<p>- New interpretative approaches to religion and Romantic literature;</p>
<p>- Interdisciplinary concerns or interventions in past or ongoing critical debates;</p>
<p>- Considerations of Romanticism and religious thought, including Christian and non-Christian (and non-Western) theologies and philosophies;</p>
<p>- Revaluations of the relationships between Romanticism and literary, historical, artistic, philosophical, or scientific modes of expression.</p>

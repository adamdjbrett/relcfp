Hospitality is a universal virtue, one that is claimed by every culture, but what does it mean to welcome another into our country, home, space or personal narrative?</p><p>“Take off your shoes” was chosen as the title for this conference because it communicates very well the ambiguities, complexities and contradictions of the act of hospitality. On the one hand, it does not hide the power imbalance of the relationship between host and guest that will surely be explored during the conference<span> </span>but, on the other, it is an instruction that is redolent of sacred spaces in the Abrahamic religions. Receiving hospitality as well as the giving of hospitality becomes a sacred act. On the one hand it is an invitation for the guest to leave the cares of the outside world at the door and on the other it is an instruction not to bring the dirt – physical and spiritual – of the outside into the house.</p><p>During our conference this theme will be explored from numerous perspectives. Our keynote sessions will examine the hospitality offered or withheld to immigrants and refugees, the welcoming that exists within the interfaith dialogue and reflect theologically upon the theme in relation to disability. The inaugural Practical Theology Hub Event will be an interfaith conversation about hospitality. In addition to all of this there will be many short papers, workshops and informal gatherings throughout the three days. We will have stories of hospitality before each keynote that will encourage reflection in the theme and, through our very own art gallery, there will be an opportunity for delegates to tell their own hospitality story and to illustrate it through an image of a pair of shoes.</p><p>Our conference is once again online. There will, however, be opportunities for delegates to meet at various locations around the country and share hospitality and the conference experience for the duration of the three days.</p><p>Using the Whova platform, our conference is <em><strong>an online experience which will be flexible across different time-zones and as varied and creative as possible</strong></em>. Building on our successful online conferences in 2021 &amp; 2022, this platform enables <em><strong>many different kinds of engagement</strong></em> over the course of our conference, from informal chats between colleagues and friends, keynote sessions, workshops, papers and online gallery space, plus the opportunity to access conference content in the forms of recorded sessions and shared resources for six months after the event.</p><p>Whether online or in person, we look forward to giving you a very warm welcome!</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Contact our team at either: <a href="mailto:admin@biapt.org">admin@biapt.org</a> or <a href="mailto:conference@biapt.org">conference@biapt.org</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:conference@biapt.org">conference@biapt.org</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.biapt.org/event/2023-annual-conference-take-off-your-shoes-hospitality-practical-theology/" target="_blank">https://www.biapt.org/event/2023-annual-conference-take-off-your-shoes-hospitality-practical-theology/?doing_wp_cron=168…</a></div></div></div></description>

						<description>Publication Name: Deleuze and the Schizoanalysis of Performance<br/><br/><p><strong>Call for submissions:</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Deleuze and the Schizoanalysis of Performance</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Schizoanalytic Applications Series, Bloomsbury Press.</p>

<p>Since the publication of <em>Deleuze and Performance </em>(2009), Deleuze’s philosophy has inspired a number of vital interventions in the fields of performance and theatre studies. Deleuze’s thought has also played an important role in the emergence of Performance Philosophy and continues to energise theory and practice across a range of disciplinary and vocational boundaries. </p>

<p>However, relatively little research has taken an explicitly schizoanalytic approach to performance. While many of the key conceptual tools of schizoanalysis recur across the literature (the assemblage; the BwO; the abstract machine etc.), the question of whether schizoanalysis might provide a framework for analysing and creating performance has only been infrequently asked. Given the difficulty of trying to extract a schizoanalytic method from Deleuze and Guattari’s writing – and the continuing need for schizoanalysis to be more carefully addressed in the field of Deleuze studies – this is not surprising. But it does point towards two possibilities: that schizoanalysis might provide resources for creating new ways of thinking, feeling, and doing performance; and that performance might contribute to the development of new schizoanalytic methods and practices.  </p>

<p>This volume aims to pursue these possibilities. Bringing together research in Deleuze and Guattari studies, performance and theatre studies, Performance Philosophy and beyond, scholars are invited to explore a range of questions. What does a schizoanalytic theatre or performance criticism look like? Could the materialist psychiatry of <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> – and particularly an understanding of desiring-production as a ‘universal primary process’ – reshape our understanding of performance as a social and historical practice? And how do problems that are central to performance – such as ‘liveness’, participation, presence, the performing body etc. – test the schizoanalytic categories that Deleuze and Guattari most frequently deploy with reference to literary examples? How might a schizoanalytic framework operate in an applied theatre setting and what can applied theatre practices contribute to our understanding of schizoanalysis, particularly given its involvement in questions of mental health and wellbeing? In what ways can performance make legible and resist the fascism of the present? How can contemporary work in new materialism, affect theory, theatre ecologies and Performance Philosophy contribute to the emergence of a performance schizoanalysis? And what concepts will invent themselves once schizoanalysis and performance are brought together? </p>

<p><strong>Submissions:</strong></p>

<p>Scholars and practitioners are invited to propose chapters that respond to these questions (but should not feel limited by them). Abstracts should be between 400-700 words, accompanied by a short bio and affiliation, and sent to <a href="mailto:daniel.koczy@newcastle.ac.uk">daniel.koczy@newcastle.ac.uk</a> before 12/6/23. Final articles will be between 7000-10000 words, including footnotes and citations. </p></description>

			<title>Living Islam in Nigeria: Muslim Experiences in a Postcolonial State. Essays in Memory of Prof. Ismail Ayinla Babatunde Balogun</title>

Muslims, however, were not passive to the structural changes, but actively engaged with the colonial system as a whole. At times, colonial administrators bent to Muslims' concerns, but at other times, they failed to yield to their demands. Apart from such engagement, Muslims actively participated, incorporated, and adopted many aspects of colonial life. In addition, they borrowed from Christians and European practices. In the post-colonial period, Muslims lived under different political conditions. However, because Nigeria's self-government did not break the colonial system, Muslim experiences showed continuity and change from colonial to post-colonial times.</span></span></p><p><span><span>By lived religious experiences, we take a cue from the framework of lived religion. This is a framework in which religious experiences are not only understood through the text but also in the context of everyday life. This requires that we focus on how Islam is practiced by ordinary Muslims in settings like the home, community, place of work, and organizations. For this volume, we assume that the postcolonial context has impacted the religious practices and social encounters of the Muslims in Nigeria. The change in the postcolonial period has been stimulated by Muslims' resistance to colonial legacies, Islamic reform, and globalization. Evidence of this change varies but is visible in all aspects of Muslims' lived experiences. Thus, we are interested in studies examining the Muslim lived experiences in Nigeria's postcolonial context. Specifically, we welcome studies that discuss Muslims' experiences in relation to areas such as their religious practices, education, associational life, civic society, gender interreligious encounters, Muslim faith-based organizations (FBOs), clerical life, Muslim-state relations, social media, and popular culture. We seek empirical and theoretical contributions from various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The volume is in memory of Ismail Ayinla Babatunde Balogun, a professor of Islamic Studies whose works focused on Muslims' social life in postcolonial Nigeria and religion in general.

The volume will be published by a university press, to be announced later.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The word count for each article should be about 5000-7000 including references.

Global, transnational, and comparative perspectives are welcome.</p><p>Description:</p><p>This panel seeks to contextualize the current position of Muslims in Western societies as either marginalized or made hypervisible. More often than not, portrayals of Muslims in the media or popular culture focus on the adherents of the imagined category of ‘Islam,’ rendering the people behind this category invisible. In light of the all-to-common binary distinctions (secular/religious, moderns/traditional, etc.), this panel seeks to contemplate ways toward “a religious literacy that does not overdetermine the role of religion” (Rashid 61). Instead of the either/or trap, an epistemological approach allowing us to trace ‘both/and’ is sought out “since the most common Muslim life is lived amidst a congeries of various laws and norms” (Reinhart 8). The panel seeks to create a space for dialogue about how contemporary literature negotiates holistic but also nuanced identities and how Muslimness is depicted as part of the spectrum of the human experience. Moreover, the panel invites papers investigating the role of literature in shaping the perception and representation of religion and how literature thus contributes to shifting perspectives on Islam and Muslimness.</p><p>You will be able to submit abstract proposals using the online submission form (you will have to go to <a href="https://pamla.ballastacademic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://pamla.ballastacademic.com</a> to login or create an account first). <strong>The deadline to submit presentation proposals is May 31, 2023. </strong>If you have any questions, please contact the panel chair (Maria Mothes) at <a href="mailto:mmothes@uni-koblenz.de">mmothes@uni-koblenz.de</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>PAMLA</p><p>Special Session Chair: Maria Mothes, University of Koblenz, Germany</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:mmothes@uni-koblenz.de">mmothes@uni-koblenz.de</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://pamla.ballastacademic.com/Home/S/18844" target="_blank">https://pamla.ballastacademic.com/Home/S/18844</a></div></div></div></description>

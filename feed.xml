			<title>[ June 13, 2024 -  June 15, 2024] Conference or similar: Nothing Matters. On Negative Objects, Spaces, and Relations</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123530</link>
						<description>Venue: Steubenstr. 6<br/><br/><p>Nothing literally matters today. In the face of severe ecological and geopolitical crises, materiality itself is deeply affected by nothingness and negativity: landscapes are riddled with holes and voids due to massive resource extraction, mountains of waste pile up as negative matter, glaciers shrink and become monuments of loss. Thus, we are confronted with a multitude of material no‐things, non‐places, and non‐relations. What relations do we maintain with the the void, the absent, the forgotten and the vanished? Through which operations, acts, gestures, and practices is something turned into nothing? How does nothing materialize in various media milieus like film, literature, and games? And what kind of hidden potentialities may lie in material nothingness? By proposing a material, relational, and operative view on nothing, the conference ties in with recent media‐philosophical concepts like operative ontologies and anthropomediality and brings them into dialogue with interdisciplinary discussions around the negative turn recently announced in contemporary social, geographical, and media theory.</p>

			<title>[ June 3, 2024] Conference or similar: Inauguration of the exhibition Scotism Made in Louvain – The Scholastic Culture of the Franciscans in Belgium</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123526</link>
						<description>Venue: Charles Deberiotstraat 26<br/><br/><p>2024 marks the 400th anniversary of the publication of Theodor Smising’s giant volume <em>De Deo Uno</em> (printed in Antwerp in 1624), which was soon followed by a second volume <em>De Deo Trino</em> (printed in Antwerp in 1626). Smising’s work was the first printed output of what developed into a specific tradition within early modern thought, the Louvain tradition of Scotism, itself but one part of the broad Scotist tradition that build upon the thought of John Duns Scotus (ca. 1266–1308). This Louvain tradition was primarily based in the Franciscan Convent of the Holy Trinity in the famous university town. The convent itself was much older, dating back to around 1230, when the Franciscan Order was in its very beginnings and long before the University of Louvain was founded (in 1425). In 1607 a second Franciscan Convent was founded in Louvain, St. Anthony’s College, one of a series of convents established by the Irish Franciscans as a result of their persecution in their homeland by the English Protestant rulers. The Irish Franciscans in Louvain, and in their other convents on the European continent, too cultivated the intellectual heritage of Duns Scotus, editing and commenting on his works and writing new works “<em>ad mentem Scoti</em>.” Both of the Franciscan convents in Louvain were closed in the turmoils after the French Revolution. The buildings of St. Anthony’s College still exist, whereas the older “Minderbroedersklooster” (on our exhibition poster) completely vanished from the cityscape.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the Maurits Sabbe Library has acquired a large fund of Franciscan books, mostly from various houses of the Franciscan Order in Belgium that have closed their doors. Our exhibition “Scotism Made in Louvain – The Scholastic Culture of the Franciscans in Belgium” explores this material, complemented by material from the KU Leuven Central Library’s Special Collections and two manuscripts from the archives of KADOC (Documentatie- en Onderzoekscentrum voor Religie, Cultuur en Samenleving). The exhibition tells the story of a significant local scholarly tradition which is placed in the context of the broader Scotist tradition of the Early Modern Period. Whereas Scholasticism as such is often seen as an exclusively medieval phenomenon, our exhibition highlights one important aspect of <em>early modern scholastic culture</em><strong>.</strong></p>

			<title>[ September 2, 2024 -  September 4, 2024] Conference or similar: Third Austrian Summer School in Phenomenology</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123450</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>The Austrian Society for Phenomenology launches its third international summer school. Our objective is to promote the research of young scholars (bachelor, master, and doctoral students) that sheds new phenomenological light on current debates in epistemology, metaethics, and metaphysics. The descriptive analysis of lived experience, the eidetic study of the various modes of intentionality, and the epistemic role and normative dimensions ascribed to experience constitute the cornerstones of phenomenological research. In particular, Husserl’s conceptions of originary givenness, evaluative experience, and eidetic intuition are among the various seminal contributions we find in the phenomenological tradition. Currently, promising research is done that utilizes such conceptions in order to develop phenomenological perspectives on experiential justification, the debate between epistemic internalism and externalism, the theory of value, (moral) emotions, moral epistemology, issues surrounding metaphysical realism and anti-realism, as well as the epistemology and metaphysics of modality. We would like to encourage students to develop phenomenological insights and teachings systematically and in view of contemporary debates in philosophy. Our ambition is to promote such phenomenological research by providing a platform to connect with, discuss with, and receive feedback from peers and experts. Each conference day is devoted to one of the subtopics of the event.</p></description>

			<title>[ June 28, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Resilience against extremism: Protecting individuals, communities, and democratic institutions</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123426</link>
						<description><p>This workshop focuses on the concept of resilience against extremism. “Resilience” refers to an individual’s or community’s ability to adapt and thrive in adverse or challenging circumstances by knowing how to find, create, access, and navigate meaningful coping resources. Extremism threatens individuals, communities, institutions, and societies on multiple dimensions. First, they are confronted with extreme behaviour and its consequences. Second, they are confronted with the presence of extremism in their environment, fostering adverse conditions. Third, they may themselves run the risk of radicalisation. Pro-social resilience against all these adversities is a complex phenomenon requiring a broad range of methodological perspectives and approaches.</p>
<p> Relevant questions include but are not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>How should we conceptualise resilience against extremism in light of different fields’ approaches to the issue? Is, for instance, resilience always prosocial?</li>
<li>What role do cultural, political, economic, and other systemic factors play in fostering resilience and how do they relate to beliefs and dispositions of individuals that constitute communities? </li>
<li>Which individuals, groups and institutions are responsible for fostering pro-social resilience, and how do these responsibilities interact?</li>
<li>Is resilience of a community compatible with the radicalisation of some of its members? </li>
<li>How does resilience in the moral, political, and religious domains relate to each other? For example, does moral resilience foster religious resilience or vice versa?</li>
<li>Can resilience be operationalised and measured? </li>
<li>How does resilience relate to deradicalization and disengagement from extremist behaviour? </li>
<li>How should we construe the resilience of democratic institutions and societies ontologically and epistemologically, in contrast with the resilience of individuals or communities?</li>
<li>Are there specific best practices for building resilience towards, for example, right-wing extremism, Salafi Jihadism, inceldom, and radical conspiracy theorizing that can be implemented elsewhere? </li>
<li>What is the role of education in creating resilience?</li>
<li>What are religious and secular resources - beliefs, practices, rituals, systems - that can help make communities resilient against radicalization?</li>
<li>Should radicalisation itself be modelled as a resilient but dysfunctional response to adverse circumstances?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keynotes:</strong></p>

<p>Michele Grossman (Deakin)</p>
<p>John Horgan (Georgia State)</p>

<p><strong>Format:</strong></p>
<p>Two-day workshop consisting of 5 keynote lectures, various shorter lectures, and a few lightning talks (probably some 15-20 presentations in total).

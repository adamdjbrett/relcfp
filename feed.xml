						<description><p>The development of natural language models gives an opportunity to use AI-chatbots in religious discourse analysis, as well as to test them as possible theologians.</p>
<p>Many practical and philosophical questions arise on these grounds. Let us list out only a few of them. Are such chatbots really helpful in those analyses? Can they be really good logicians (if they don't "know" when they say true sentences) and good theologians (if they are not humans)? Can we train a model to make it operating like Thomas Aquinas (or at least some of his disciples)?</p>
<p>At this workshop we will collect results of such experiments which include <u>both theological and logical</u> perspective.</p>
<p>Topics may include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>testing theological and logical skills of AI-chatbots,</li>
<li>comparison of different AI-chatbots/AI-models with respect to such logical and theological skills,</li>

Following their lead, scholars in the past two decades have charted how <em>Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum </em>navigates intricate issues of gender, genre, patronage, courtly politics, religion, and poetic authority. This panel aims to expand this fruitful work by exploring new avenues for scholarship that consider Lanyer’s engagement with other contexts and discourses. Accordingly, this panel seeks papers that either examine new courses of inquiry or reevaluate established topics of Lanyer scholarship. Paper topics might include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embodiment or Humoralism</li>
<li>Sensation or Sensorium</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Ecology or Nature</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Classical Reception</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper title (15 words maximum)</li>
<li>Abstract (200 words maximum)</li>
<li>Brief CV (1 page maximum)</li>
<li>PhD or other terminal degree completion year (past or expected)</li>
<li>Full name, current affiliation, and e-mail address</li>

			<title>[ June 23, 2023] Conference or similar: A.I. Aesthetics (III)</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/111734</link>
						<description>Venue: Campo Grande, Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa<br/><br/><p><strong>Research Workshop Series <em>A.I. Aesthetics &amp; Philosophy of Technology</em> org. by Alexander Gerner</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.I. Aesthetics III</strong></p>
<p><strong>23.6.2023 hybrid event</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>23/06/2023</strong></p>
<p>FCUL (Universidade de Lisboa) &amp; online</p>
<p><strong>11-18h</strong></p>
<p>A.I. Aesthetics III Workshop <em>org. </em><em>Alexander Gerner, Renata Silva Souza, Vinicius de Aguiar</em><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>"And even if we did succeed in doing so, it would still remain true, that the machine would remain utterly devoid of original initiative and would only do the special kind of thing it had been calculated to do. This, however, is no defect in a machine; we do not want it to do its own business, but ours." C.S. Peirce Logical Machines (1887)</em></p>
<p>*<strong></strong></p>

<p>The study of computational aesthetics in the combination of computer science and A.I. examines how machines can assess aesthetics or display creativity or mimic aesthetic behavior. This field does not require artificial consciousness but instead relies on stochastics, algorithms and models that can imitate human aesthetic judgments or generateaesthetic outputs that might be judged by humans as aesthetically valuable. A.I. utopias envision a future where machine learning agential systemsare not only tools engaged for efficiency, convenience, substitution of work or programmed profit but as well as explorations of the aesthetic and the sensible and intervene into our social common.</p>
<p>Still, AI systems might be proposed as a means for promoting the common good, public interest, fostering green transition, and even human values that underlie our diverse societies and ecosystems. What consequences do diverse forms of A.I. aesthetics, social-ethical and political participation in algorithmic society entail today? What <em>praxeology of humanities </em>must engage us concerning increasingly ubiquitous, intimate, affective calculations, computation and design by machine learning, and the cybernetic formalizations of human cultural techniques such as language, among others, for safeguarding our common futures?</p>
<p>In the early days of computer-generated art (Jones et al. 2023) from the 1950s onwards the works of computer art pioneers were influenced by <em>mathematics, geometry, physics, </em><em>combinatorial writing, </em><em>and music</em>, as well as by <em>abstract art movements</em> such as <em>constructivism</em> and <em>op art</em>. They were often experimental, exploratory, and <em>playful</em>, as the artists discovered new <em>possibilities and limitations of the machines and their </em><em>co-</em><em>creativity</em>, which reflected the social and <strong>cultural changes brought by the</strong> <strong><em>computerization of society</em></strong>. As computer technology evolved, artists began to use algorithms and other mathematical rules to create art- often to the <em>detriment of the materiality(Nake 2010:60)</em> aspect of the work. However, the value of the works was always debated, as early works were often seen as aesthetic design rather than art as it was frequently "<em>biased toward attracting the attention of our brain's most basic pattern-recognition </em>skills"(Barrow, 1995 cit.in: Taylor(2004:148)<em> </em>lacking artistic "<em>resonance."</em></p>
<p><em>We want to investigate the following questions among others:</em></p>
<p><em>Do </em><em>A.I. </em><em>generations</em><em> enhance </em><em>aesthetic indeterminacy</em><em></em><em>(</em><em>Zeilinger</em><em></em><em>2023) by enabling </em><em>social scaffolding, diagrammatic reasoning, abduction, </em><em>human </em><em>Learning, </em><em>and development,</em><em> and contribute substantially to the UNESCO 2030 development goals?</em></p>
<p><em>How is democratic participation changed by A.I.Aesthetics?</em></p>
<p><em>Does </em><em>AI-generated art serve the interests of </em><em>powerful digital platforms </em><em>that exploit users' data and </em><em>historical works and </em><em>labor by using A.I. as a marketing</em><em>, influencer, and manipulation</em><em> tool or a surveillance device that collects personal information and preferences</em><em>?</em><em></em><em>  </em></p>
<p><em>Is A.I. aesthetics praxis diminishing the reality index in which mean/demeaning images (Steyerl 2023) feed on latent spaces of exchange value, use value and commodity (cf. Adorno), critically assessed as based on a wrong idea of intelligence that could be designated dependently its perspective, "uncreative intelligence" (Mersch), "Artificial idiocy" (Zizek), “dumb meaning” (Bajohr 2022), or a satisficing (Hubert Simon) "cliché-generator"?</em></p>
<p><em>How does A.I. Aesthetics relate to society?</em></p>
<p><em>How did A.I. aesthetics co-evolve, mix, change and differ from other computer art and electronic arts, game aesthetics, beginning and aesthetic developments?</em></p>
<p><em>Are the new A.I. tools living up to their metaphors such as machine "hallucinations" or "dreams" (DeepDream) or even "windows into alternate realities in the latent space" (Emad Mostaque, Twitter, 7/3/2023)?</em></p>
<p><em>How A.I. aesthetics is related to social scaffolding, diagrammatic reasoning, abduction, </em><em>human </em><em>Learning?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>How can we reach out fr</em></strong><strong><em>om Style</em></strong><strong><em> transfer</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>of A.I. remakes/remixes to</em></strong><strong><em> societal vision transfer?</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong><em></em></p>
<p><em>How is </em><em>Governance of A.I. through democratic processes</em><em> and AI aesthetics</em><em> </em><em>strengthened or weakened?</em></p>
<p><em>What role does A.I. aesthetics play in architecture, urban planning, green, digital transition</em><em>s</em><em>,</em><em> and questions of the digital-sensible divide</em><em>?</em></p>
<p>We ask participants interested in Participationin this third collaborative and interdisciplinary workshop on A.I. Aesthetics to contribute with a shortintervention/presentation (of up to 20min). You are invited to send a brief max 300-500 word research statement, a title,</p>

<p>There have been three editions of the WoCoLoR: in Joao Pessoa, Brazil (2015), in Warsaw, Poland (2017), and in Varanasi, India (2022). They provoked interesting discussions, inspired the cooperation of scholars representing various fields, and yielded many interesting results, which were later published in several volumes. </p>
<p>Among previous keynote speakers: Saul Kripke (Schock Prize), Laurent Lafforgue (Fields Medal), Michal Heller (Templeton Prize), Dov Gabbay, Jan Wolenski, Piergiorgio Odifreddi.</p>
<p>The 4th World Congress on Logic and Religion--4th WoCoLoR 2023--will be held at Sinaia, Romania, on September 3-8, 2023. </p>
<p>We invite all the scholars (philosophers, logicians, mathematicians, theologians and others) to submit abstracts of papers for the 4th Congress on Logic and Religion. The topics of the papers should deal with the relationships between logic and religion. </p>
<p>Talks will be presented either in the general session or in one of the workshops:</p>
<p>&gt;  Religious Symbolism and Symbolic Logic</p>
<p>&gt; Logic of Reconciliation</p>
<p>&gt; Applying Mathematics to Theology</p>
<p>&gt; Concepts of God: Consistency, Inconsistency and Paraconsistency Issues</p>

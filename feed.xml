<p>From its earliest moments in medieval Britain and colonial America, Anglophone children’s literature was built on a foundation of religion. Even when not positioned as explicitly religious, the dominant British and colonial religion of Christianity infused children’s books with church-based morals, and references to Christmas and Jesus were taken for granted. Since then, religion has continued to be an important aspect of children’s literature, but the relationships between religion, culture, children’s literature, education, and libraries have changed several times. Now, in the twenty-first century, Anglophone children’s literature is often more conscious of religious and international diversity, having been influenced by movements like We Need Diverse Books and grassroots organizations serving religious and cultural minorities. At the same time, increasing social and political polarization affects the production of children’s literature, especially when controversial topics are so often tied to religious ideologies. Recent developments like new manifestations of religious nationalism, the rise of antisemitism and Islamophobia, the splintering of the Methodist church, Pope Francis’ decision to allow Catholic clergy to bless same-sex relationships, the growing rate of young adults leaving religious communities, and differentiation within a variety of indigenous and diasporic religions make the time ripe for reconsideration of academic discussions about the role of religion and belief in children’s literature.</p>
<p>This special issue aims to revive and expand long-standing conversations about the roots and continued presence of religion in children’s literature, beyond consideration of early Christian influences. For example, children’s literature has been shaped by many developments including:</p>
<p>●       fundamental changes in religious institutions;</p>
<p>●       cross-cultural influences within and between religions;</p>
<p>●       secularization and resistance to secularization;</p>
<p>●       grappling with and/or reconciliation of creationism and evolution;</p>
<p>●       movements intersecting with religion (e.g., ongoing civil rights struggles, feminism, LGBTQ+ advocacy, abortion access, environmental activism, decolonial movements, Black Lives Matter).</p>
<p>With an eye towards interfaith dialogue and inclusion, we will feature a variety of perspectives on religion and culture in children’s and young adult literature.</p>
<p>We invite submissions of proposals for this special issue of <em>The Lion and the Unicorn </em>to be published in Spring 2026. Please submit <strong>abstracts of 400-500 words</strong> for <strong>full-length essays (8,000-10,000 words)</strong> addressing, challenging, and/or developing ideas about the current state of religion and culture, broadly defined, in texts for children and young adults in a variety of religious and cultural contexts. We especially encourage papers considering non-Western and non-Abrahamic religious traditions, papers engaging with intersectionality, and papers considering old ideas in a new light.</p>
<p>Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>●       Does religion still matter in twenty-first-century youth literature?</p>
<p>●       How does the post-secular and/or post-humanist age affect religious content in youth literature, and vice versa?</p>
<p>●       How does the current state of religion in children’s literature and the relationship between religious cultures and children’s literature fit within the longer history of children’s publishing?</p>
<p>●       What is the legacy of canonical authors or enduring representations of religious practice in children’s literature?</p>
<p>●       What has happened to the “Christmas chapter,” especially in series fiction? What role have those episodes, so long a staple of Anglophone children’s texts, played in shaping youth literature, national religious consciousness, politics, etc.?</p>
<p>●       What does children’s literature still lack in the realm of religion and culture? Why are those elements important, and what prevents them from being represented?</p>
<p>●       How are the many voices within individual religious or cultural communities represented? What are some of the internal debates, and how do they affect either niche or mainstream publishing?</p>
<p>●       Are there significant differences in religious representations between books published for a mainstream audience and ones published for an internal religious or cultural community? Between books distributed in a single country versus books distributed globally?</p>
<p>●       How does the religious or cultural affiliation of the perceived or intended audience affect the narratives of children’s texts?</p>
<p>●       What are the functions of youth libraries in religious cultural centers like mosques, synagogues, churches, or temples? What kinds of book-centered programming happens in these centers, and what role do they play in the representation of religion and culture in children’s literature?</p>
<p>●       How do public libraries and/or public schools use materials with overt or subtle religious messaging? What kinds of book-centered religious programming do public libraries and/or public schools plan? How does this vary based on community demographics?</p>
<p>●       How do local or national standards of education in subjects like “world religions” influence which books make their way into the curriculum? How are these books utilized in lesson plans?</p>
<p>●       At a time when librarianship, children’s literature scholarship, and publishing have committed to diversifying representation, what role does the age-old question of quality in children’s texts play in various contexts including religious communities, professional educators, scholars, etc.?</p>
<p>●       How does religious content in youth literature shape the cultural consciousness of youth in all religious traditions (including none), of the publishing industry, and/or of professional organizations?</p>
<p>●       What role do children’s editions of sacred texts and/or study guides play in the broader market of youth literature?</p>
<p>●       Is there a significant difference between religion as represented in fantasy and religion as presented in contemporary or historical realism? What are the effects of those differences on readers?</p>
<p>●       Do books about contemporary youth and religion differ in any significant ways from books drawing on religious pasts or legends?</p>
<p>●       Does age matter? How do picture books, early readers, middle grade books, and/or young adult books differ in their engagement with or representation of religious and cultural content?</p>
<p>●       How does youth literature with religious content address or engage with often-controversial themes like social justice, the environment, etc.? How does a religious lens influence the messaging around these topics? What are the differences between various religions’ and denominations’ approaches to these topics?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>●       How does religion function in any or all aspects of youth literature and youth media more broadly?</p>

<p><strong>May 11-12, 2024</strong><br/><strong>May 11 will be at Birkbeck (for both in-person and online presentations)<br/>May 12 will be held fully online.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Call for Papers</strong></p>
<p>Ever since the dawn of time, there has been an art-based approach to spirituality. People have created and developed ritualistic relationships with artefacts in order to help them understand, express, and communicate with the divine. From jewellery to iconography, music, garments, sculptures, architecture, incense, and more, these objects of art have encapsulated and preserved religious symbols and traditions over many generations.</p>
<p>This conference aims to bring together researchers, postgraduate students, and creatives interested in the role that religious artefacts and rituals can play in our perception of the sacred. In this transdisciplinary forum, we will be sharing ideas relating to all aspects of art and the divine, especially regarding matter, materials, and materiality in religious cultures throughout the ages. Art is associated with religious traditions around the world, and sacred objects/artefacts (such as icons, sculptures, jewellery, garments, architecture, etc.) have the capacity to depict and describe archetypal, spiritual concepts and religious content through matter. We would like to explore topics revolving around the connection between religions and material culture, especially in observing the relationships between people and sacred artefacts, whether these relationships are of spiritual, informative, creative, scientific or ekphrastic nature.</p>
<p>We would like to explore the following questions: How can religious artefacts shape our understanding of the divine? What type of ekphrastic responses may be generated between different mediums of religious art? What factors come into play in the making and development of iconography and other art of religious significance? How can archaeological findings tell us more about the history of the sacred in our psyche?</p>
<p>We welcome 15-minute presentations of either academic or creative form.</p>
<p>Central topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconography: process, meaning, making, and using</li>
<li>Calligraphy</li>
<li>Ekphrastic responses to sacred art (such as icons)</li>
<li>Art-based rituals in spiritual practice</li>
<li>Cross-cultural interactions and influences</li>
<li>Archaeological discoveries through these artefacts</li>
<li>Modes of interaction between different cultures/faiths in the creation and use of artefacts with religious significance</li>
<li>Spiritual architecture</li>
<li>Special processes and techniques in iconography</li>
<li>Renovation of artefacts</li>
<li>Sacred music</li>
<li>Food in religious practice</li>
<li>Religious sculpture</li>
<li>Classicism and neo-classicist approaches to religion through art</li>
<li>The Renaissance</li>
<li>Religious symbols in art of ancient civilizations</li>
<li>The contemporary use of ancient religious symbols in art, fashion, and rituals</li>
<li>Comparative religion</li>
<li>Religious manuscripts</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary conversations</li>
<li>Consciousness and the imaginal realm</li>
<li>Archetypal expressions</li>
<li>Spiritual symbolism</li>
<li>Mythology as methodology</li>
<li>Alchemical symbolism</li>
</ul>
<p>Held at the University of London, Birkbeck (as well as online), this two-day hybrid conference will take place on <strong>11-12 May, 2024</strong>. The first day, <strong>May 11</strong> will be at Birkbeck (for both in-person and online presentations), and the second day, <strong>May 12</strong> will be held fully online.</p>
<p>Presenters may either share academic papers and/or creative work (poetry, prose, photography, music, painting, etc.), as we highly encourage arts-based research, as well as research which stimulates reflection on creativity, image, symbol and archetype. Please fill out our proposal form on <a href="https://forms.gle/4sEr597f8ZPB6AJZ6">https://forms.gle/4sEr597f8ZPB6AJZ6</a> by <strong>April 1, 2024</strong>.

In his extant fragments, Democritus claims that the poet writes by divine inspiration (fr. 17) and that Homer's greatness is due to his godlike nature (fr. 21). But the great systematiser of this doctrine is undoubtedly Plato, in dialogues such as the <em>Phaedrus</em>, <em>The Laws</em> and, above all, the <em>Ion</em>: the poet's art cannot be explained by craftsmanship, but by a divine rapture of which the poet remains ignorant. This notion had a long history in Antiquity, and is reformulated in the works of Cicero, Horatius, Seneca or Statius, among others. In the Middle Ages, <em>furor poeticus</em> was easily assimilated into Christian categories, leading to the ideology of the poet as a "scriba Dei" in authors such as Alain de Lille or Dante Alighieri.</p>
<p>With the revival of Neoplatonism in Western Europe, the humanists of the fifteenth century took up the teachings of Plato and adapted them to the needs of their own time. Coluccio Salutati, Leonardo Bruni and other representatives of Florentine civic humanism provided the first modern reception of the idea, using Cicero and Isidore of Seville as primary sources. It was Marsilio Ficino, translator and commentator on the <em>Ion</em>, who gave the concept its modern form. In his 1457 epistle <em>De Divino Furore</em> and in his treatise on <em>Theologia Platonica</em> (1482), Ficino identifies four types of divine inspiration ("furor divinus"), one of which is "furor poeticus": the divine power that possesses true literary creators. Ficino's followers, such as Poliziano or Landino, adopted the Platonic concept, but also raised the old problem of whether inspiration (<em>ingenium</em>) alone was sufficient, or whether it had to be combined with a mastery of poetic craftsmanship (<em>ars</em>).</p>
<p>The edited volume (under negotiation with a top international publisher) seeks to explore the afterlife of this poetological idea in modern literature and poetics in the broadest sense from sixteenth century to the present.</p>
<p>The edited volume invites essays on the following themes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>-<em>Furor poeticus</em> in the Renaissance and beyond: Ludovico Ariosto, Giordano Bruno, Marco Girolamo Vida, George Chapman, George Puttenham, John of the Cross and the mystics, the poets of La Pléiade… What are the links of these authors with Neoplatonism, Orphism, Christianity and other religions or spiritual movements?</p>
<p>-In eighteenth-century aesthetics, the concept of genius seems to take the place traditionally occupied by <em>furor poeticus</em>: Lord Shaftesbury, Edmund Burke, Edward Young, William Duff, Immanuel Kant...</p>
<p>-The Romantic appropriation of the idea of <em>furor poeticus</em> in authors such as Hölderlin, Hamann, Coleridge, Blake, De Quincey. Divine rapture turns into personal madness.</p>
<p>-Secularisations of <em>furor poeticus</em> from the nineteenth century onwards: Schopenhauer interprets it as a mental illness and Freud as adult daydreams that replace child's play.</p>
<p>-Presences of <em>furor poeticus</em> in contemporary literary theory: Harold Bloom's concept of "influence" or Angus Fletcher's concept of "allegory".</p>
<p>-Reception and transformation of the idea in contemporary writers: Antonin Artaud, Ted Hughes, Anne Sexton, Leopoldo María Panero… Comparative approaches are also welcome.</p>
<p>Please submit your proposal title and a 600-800 words abstract together with a short CV including current affiliation, academic position, ORCID and main publications. All essays, written in English, must be original and unpublished.</p>
<p>Abstracts should be emailed by 15 March 2024 to <a href="mailto:furorpoeticuscall@gmail.com">furorpoeticuscall@gmail.com</a></p>

			<title>[ August 31, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Science, Causality and God : Divine Action in a Scientific Age</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/120646</link>
						<description><p>The 2024 Online Conference Series celebrates Key Themes from Arthur Peacocke's Work in what would have been his 100th year. Delegates are invited to re-engage with these themes from multi-faith perspectives and examine how they interact with the scientific, technological, and environmental challenges and opportunities posed by the 21st Century.</p>
<p>“What kind of conception of how God acts in or, more generally, interacts with, the world can we possibly have in the light of scientific perspectives on that world – the presuppositions of which also underlie our scientific, psychological, sociological and historical events in human experience?” (Peacocke, Theology for a Scientific Age p.139)</p>
<p>We invite papers which (re-)engage with the question of divine action and causality within the science-religion dialogue. We welcome papers from a broad range of religious and faith perspectives and the papers do not need to engage directly with Peacocke’s own work, only central themes. The conference will explore and challenge key themes around divine action, causality, and science including:</p>
<p>•Forces, causality, and Divine Action</p>
<p>•God’s interaction and communication with the world</p>
<p>•Divine Action, the Causal Joint, and consciousness</p>
<p>•Laws of nature, ecology, and divine action</p>
<p>•Creation, co-creation, and continuous creation</p></description>

<p>“For the processes of the world exhibit an intelligible continuity in which the potentialities of its constituents are unfolded in forms of an ever-increasing complexity and organisation” (Peacocke, Theology for a Scientific Age p.300)</p>
<p>We invite papers which (re-)engage with the question of emergence within the science-religion dialogue. We welcome papers from a broad range of religious and faith perspectives and the papers do not need to engage directly with Peacocke’s own work, only central themes. The conference will explore and challenge key theological and religious themes around emergence including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Purpose, design, and emergent complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consciousness, emergence and the biological sciences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reductionism, emergence, and religious reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emergence and divine action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of emergence on science-religion relationships</p>
</li>

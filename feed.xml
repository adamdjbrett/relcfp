			<title>[ June 8, 2023 -  June 10, 2023] Conference or similar: Phenomenology: Linguistic or Eidetic?</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107550</link>
						<description>Venue: Universitätsplatz 3<br/><br/><p>The contrast alluded to in the title is that between what J. L. Austin called “linguistic phenomenology” (Philosophical Papers, p. 182), commonly referred to as ordinary language philosophy (= OLP), and phenomenology as founded by Edmund Husserl. “Phenomenology” is here meant to include figures like Eugen Fink, Adolf Reinach or Merleau-Ponty, but also influential secessionists like Heidegger or Derrida. The former tradition is understood as including the likes of Wittgenstein, Ryle, Alan R. White or Cavell. Papers will either cut across the traditions or be basic in a way that makes them relevant for both of them. Husserl and Austin will be the main, but not the sole, focus of the conference. The following topics have been suggested for discussion:<br/><br/>(1) “S is p” – A Basic Structure of Judgement?<br/><br/>(2) The “Natural Attitude” vs. the Ordinary<br/><br/>(3) Transcendental Subjectivity vs. the “We” of OLP<br/><br/>(4) Voice and Subjectivity<br/><br/>(5) The Inner and the Outer</p>
<p>This workshop is funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Erwin-Schrödinger Grant J 4534-G. For more information, mail to bernhard.ritter AT uni-graz.at or visit.</p></description>

			<title>[ June 26, 2023 -  June 30, 2023] Conference or similar: Gratitude</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107570</link>
						<description>Venue: 1235 University Blvd<br/><br/><p>In this seminar we will explore gratitude as a fundamental moral disposition without which no one can really be happy. <br/>Our culture today is fraught by questions about gratitude. How do we receive in gratitude the goods of our own traditions despite their evils, of which we are increasingly aware? Can we cultivate gratitude in a social-media world of envy, isolation, and self-assertion? Why should we be grateful in the midst of great suffering?<br/><br/>In this seminar, we will attempt to answer these questions and to offer gratitude as an antidote to other challenges, such as feelings of loneliness, resentment, envy, and the self-hatred that oppresses so many today. We will show how gratitude guards against despair, and resists the nihilist attitude that fails to see the value of anything.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we will propose gratitude as an essential condition of human happiness and human flourishing.  In so doing, we will explore the relations between gratitude and contemplation, stewardship, and material creation; between gratitude and wonder, creativity, and invention; between gratitude and beauty, hope, and joy; and between gratitude, self-love, and the love of God.   The seminar will draw on ideas in from the history of philosophy, medieval philosophy, contemporary virtue theory, phenomenology, and personalism, as well as aesthetics and poetics.   Several keynote addresses will be given by <br/><br/>—John F. Crosby, Professor Emeritus at Franciscan University and author of The Selfhood of the Human Person and The Personalism of John Henry Newman<br/>—Jonathan J. Sanford, President at the University of Dallas, author of Before Virtue: Assessing Contemporary Virtue Ethics<br/>—Mark Spencer, professor at the University of St. Thomas (MN), author of The Irreducibility of the Human Person: A Catholic Synthesis <br/>—James Matthew Wilson, Professor in the MFA program at University of St. Thomas (Houston), author of The Vision of the Soul: Truth, Goodness, and Beauty in the Western Tradition<br/><br/>A full list of faculty can be found on the event website.  </p>

						<description><p>The Institute of Suhrawardi’s Wisdom in collaboration with some academic centers organizes an international conference to reread the thoughts of Shaikh al-Ishraq. Rereading Suhrawardi's thoughts is of great importance for the new generation who live in a different world from Suhrawardi's time. There is no need to say that in this rereading, due to the critical nature of the modern world, there may be some criticisms of those ideas. This international conference, which will be held in person and online in March 2023, originates from the view that original premodern intellectual traditions can be the source of insight and inspiration for contemporary human being in solving his/her complicated problems.</p>

						<description>Publication Name: EXTENDED: Vice, Virtue, &amp; Conflict (Theophron Spring 2023)<br/><br/><p>Taken narrowly, vice and virtue comprise both central considerations of virtue ethical theories and peripheral considerations of any sophisticated normative ethics—that is, all plausible normative ethics will comment on vice and virtue in some manner. Taken broadly, the terms relate to goodness and badness, righteousness and evil, morality and depravity, inculcation and elimination. In each of these conjunctions, conflict stands at the forefront. Similar tensions manifest across theory and lived experience, from disagreement and wars to schisms and debates on the very existence of God. The interplay of vice, virtue, and conflict, then, occasions inquiry into the facets of life in a broken world and faith in the One who alone is perfect.</p>
<p>With this topic in mind, we invite undergraduate and graduate students, as well as early-career post-docs, to submit to Theophron’s spring 2023 issue. Scholarship from all fields, particularly philosophy, theology, history, and biblical studies, is welcome.</p>
<p>Possible topics include but are certainly not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>●  Epistemology of Religious or Moral Disagreement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Virtue’s Role in Christian Discipleship across Traditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Prophetic &amp; Apostolic Responses to Political-Religious Tensions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Moral Arguments for God’s Existence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Interpretations of Old Testament Conflict Narratives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Just War Theory &amp; Pacifism in World War II</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Early Church Understandings of Spiritual Conflict</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Historical Christian Responses to Global Strife</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Metaethics and Theories of Sin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>●  Protestant, Catholic, &amp; Orthodox Views of Vice</p>
<p>Submission Instructions<br/>Submissions should be between 4,000–6,500 words (not including abstract), conform to the Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition), and be original, unpublished works prepared for double- blind peer review. Please include an abstract of no more than 250 words, uploading the entire manuscript in both PDF and .docx formats at www.theophron.org/submissions. Do not place your name or any identifying information on the submitted manuscript—author identities will remain anonymous to reviewers and editors until after final acceptance/rejection decisions.</p>
<p>Extended: Submissions received by February 26, 2023, will be considered for publication. Direct all questions to submissions@theophron.org.<br/>Visit theophron.org for all live calls for papers, including our year-round, open-topic call.</p>

</p><p align="center"><strong>Pliny the Elder: Medicine, Magic, and Religion</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In 2023 the world will celebrate the bimillenary of the birth of Pliny the Elder, who is a widely known author but not studied as much as he deserves. Despite the general interest shown in Pliny and his <em>Natural History</em>, there is still much to explore in his work. Examples of important titles of Plinian scholarship include the monograph of Beagon (1992) and her commentary on Book 7 of the <em>Natural History </em>(2005); Doody’s monograph on the reception of Pliny’s <em>Natural History </em>(2010); the edited volume of Gibson and Morello (2011); and the edited volume of Traina and Vial-Logeay (2022).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to foster further investigation of Pliny and explore themes and issues that have not yet been fully investigated, the Centre for Classical Studies of the School of Arts and Humanities of the University of Lisbon, in collaboration with the Sapienza Università di Roma, is organising two international conferences on the theme ‘Pliny the Elder: Medicine, Magic, and Religion’ to be held during the autumn of 2023.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main goal of these conferences is to study the books of Pliny’s <em>Naturalis Historia </em>that have particular significance in three areas that frequently intersect: medicine, magic, and religion. Researchers and scholars of Pliny and of these areas are invited to submit abstracts for papers to be delivered at these conferences. Speakers are encouraged to employ philological, historical, historico-religious, and anthropological approaches in their presentations, which may investigate any of the following (or other) topics:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pliny and medicine</p>
<ul>
<li>Pliny’s sources;</li>
<li>medical areas are covered;</li>
<li>the reception of Pliny in ancient, medieval and Renaissance medicine. </li>
</ul>
<p> Pliny and magic
</p><ul>
<li>views of Pliny on magic;</li>
<li>practices;</li>
<li>(possible) relation to medicine and/or religion. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Pliny and religion</p>
<ul>
<li><em>superstitio </em>and <em>prodigia</em>;</li>
<li>Pliny and ancient religion;</li>
<li>deities, rituals and religious practices.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Proposals for a 20-minute presentation should be sent to <a href="mailto:pliniusbimillenary@gmail.com">pliniusbimillenary@gmail.com</a> by 31 March 2023. Abstracts should have a maximum of 300 words and include a short biographical note with academic affiliation(s) and main publications (100 words).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Provisional places and dates for these conferences are Lisbon (19-20 October 2023) and Rome (9-10 November 2023). The organisers plan to host the presentation of papers on medicine in Lisbon and papers on magic and religion in Rome. These places and dates will be confirmed so that participants can make appropriate travel plans well in advance of the conferences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The working languages for these conferences will be English and Italian.</p>

<p>Twenty-Seventh Annual Meeting 14–16 October 2023 Toronto, ON, Canada</p>
<p>The IAEP Executive Committee is excited to announce our annual meeting, immediately following SPEP, in Canada’s largest city Toronto.</p>
<p>Keynote Speaker Stephanie LeMenager</p>
<p>University of Oregon</p>
<p>IAEP invites proposals for individual papers as well as organized panels on any aspect of environmental philosophy. Papers in areas touching on LeMenager’s work–the anthropocene, resource exploration, feminist and interdisciplinary approaches to environmental philosophy, etc.—would certainly be welcome.</p>

			<title>[ September 28, 2023 -  September 30, 2023] Conference or similar: Eco-phenomenology and Passivity</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/107309</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p><strong>Eco-Phenomenology and Passivity Conference</strong></p>
<p><strong>Call for Papers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Place: UiT – The Arctic University of Norway (Tromsø)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dates: 28-30 September 2023</strong></p>
<p>Phenomenology is a tradition of thinking that acknowledges the already-givenness of our bodies, our relationships to others, and the ecosystems in which we live. Since the founding of the field in the early twentieth century, phenomenologists have taken an interest in the ways that humans engage the world that precedes us, but it was only in the last twenty years that scholars recognized the potential phenomenology could have for environmental ethics and the ongoing multi-disciplinary rethinking of our human relationship to the more-than-human world. Since then, scholars approaching environmental ethics from within philosophy, literature, theology, anthropology, and cognitive science have drawn consistently on the vocabulary and methodologies of phenomenology to approach questions of: how we understand and can better anticipate human impacts on ecosystems; what it means to dwell/be at home in a specific ecosystem; what role the perception of animals plays in individual and community environmental impact; and how human embodiment can be reconceived as dependent on the natural world that exceeds us. Related to this are questions of cultural ways of being toward nature that undermine the assumption of human dominance.</p>
<p>Building on prior work on the phenomenology of embodiment, subjectivity, ethics, and most recently passivity, this conference consolidates contemporary thinking on the phenomenology of passivity and environmental ethics. Passivity is a key concept in phenomenology. By passivity, we refer to all the ways in which we receive and are conditioned by the surrounding world prior to active attempts to master it. Thus far, passivity´s relevance to environmental philosophy and ethics has been obscured by a focus on environmental activism. Indeed, from an activist perspective, passivity tends to be understood as a “do-nothing” attitude that will lead to environmental disaster. Rather than defining passivity in opposition to activism, participants in this conference will explore passivity as linked to givenness, inter-dependence and environmental response-ability, conceived of in relation to the present generation´s need to respond to prior human damage to the earth, natural forces beyond our control, and the anticipated needs of multi-species future.</p>
<p>Ted Toadvine, Arne Johan Vetlesen, Michael Marder and Simone Kotva will give keynote presentations. We welcome proposals for additional presentations of around 20 minutes each.</p>
<p>Please send abstracts of 300-400 words to Cassandra.falke@uit.no by March 15th 2023. Emails regarding acceptance will be sent by April 15th.</p></description>

As a result, scholarship has primarily focused on the rabbinic elite represented in and responsible for the Talmud. However, hundreds of Jewish magical amulets written on bowls provide access to the unknown lives and practices of Jews in the very cities in which the Babylonian rabbis flourished. These magical texts may serve as a rare vantage point from which to reconstruct the social and cultural history of Jews in the Sasanian empire. This lecture will focus on slavery and enslaved individuals in the Sasanian empire through their appearance in the Aramaic incantation bowl texts. In addition, the speaker will point to evidence that connects slaves with the demonic in the magic bowls and in other magical sources, through texts and in imagery.</p><p>Dr. Avigail Manekin-Bamberger is a senior lecturer in the Department of Jewish History and Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Her research focuses on the social and cultural history of Jews in antiquity, with a special emphasis on Jewish society in the Sasanian Empire and ancient Jewish magic.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>UCL Institute of Jewish Studies</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:ijs@ucl.ac.uk">ijs@ucl.ac.uk</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/511680358727" target="_blank">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/511680358727</a></div></div></div></description>

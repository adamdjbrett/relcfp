			<title>[ January 8, 2025] CFP for conference or similar: Phenomenology and Mysticism</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123866</link>
						<description><p>Call for Papers:  Panel sponsored by SOPHERE (the Society for the Phenomenology of Religious Experience) at the Eastern Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association, 2025 <br/> Conference Panel Theme: Phenomenology and Mysticism</p>
<p>The Society for the Phenomenology of Religious Experience (SoPheRE) will be hosting a panel discussion on the topic “Phenomenology and Mysticism” at the Eastern Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association in  New York City from January 8-11, 2025. We hereby invite papers related to that theme. Possible topics to be covered include (but are not limited to):</p>
<p>--What is mysticism?  What is a mystical experience?  </p>
<p>--How do we differentiate between mystical experiences of the divine and non-mystical experiences of religious life or faith or community?  </p>
<p>--What kinds of ethical imperatives, if any, do mystical experiences or mystical writings carry?  And how and why might they carry these imperatives? </p>
<p>--How private are mystical experiences?  Can there be public ones?  If so, how are mystical experiences recognized and furthered as shared experiences? </p>
<p>--What are  resources in the  Continental and phenomenological tradition that might assist us in order to articulate the possibility or impossibility of mysticism—resources such as those in the works of Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, GWF Hegel, Jean-Luc Marion, Edith Stein, Meister Eckhart, Martin Heidegger, John Caputo, and others?</p>
<p>--How does art or literature demonstrate or call for a new kind of space or temporality that forms the structure or possibility of mysticism?</p>
<p>Papers should involve texts and discussions of phenomenology (and the phenomenological tradition within philosophy).  The papers should be designed for a maximum of 30 minutes reading time (approx. 3500 words) and be submitted for blind review by July 20, 2024. Accepted papers will be notified by August 5, 2024. All presenters must register for the Eastern Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association and be current members of SOPHERE (www.sophere.org). All papers, and any questions, should be sent to the panel organizers at <strong>dr.petercostello@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

						<description><p><strong>METAPHYSICS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>The 2025 APA Central Division Meeting will be held February 20-22, 2025, and February 27-March 1. All sessions will be on-line. The Society for Phenomenology of Religious Experience will sponsor an affiliated group session on metaphysics and religious experience.</p>
<p>Many of those who have religious/spiritual experiences find systematic metaphysics irrelevant to those experiences, and yet one might wonder whether they do depend on unexamined metaphysical presuppositions. This session will inquire into the relationship between religious/spiritual experience and metaphysics. Are religious/spiritual experiences completely independent of metaphysics? Or, do they depend on metaphysics? If so, how? If religious/spiritual experiences do depend in some way on metaphysics, do the different metaphysical frameworks people espouse (and these are often diverse, depending on the diversity of religious/spiritual traditions and cultures world-wide) affect the kinds of religious/spiritual experience they have? Does religious/spiritual experience determine what metaphysical outlook should be adopted (e.g. Classical Theism or Process Theology)? Is there a danger of equating metaphysics with religious/spiritual experience? Does such an equation end up undermining religious/spiritual experience or end up in incoherence as various critiques of onto-theology suggest? Do metaphysics and religious/spiritual experience represent distinctive and yet related provinces of meaning, in Alfred Schutz’s sense? Is there a philosophical obligation to give an account of the metaphysical suppositions underlying one religious/spiritual experience out of a sense of philosophical responsibility in Husserl’s sense? Do metaphysical articulations help build a bridge between religious/spiritual experience and science, as Max Scheler thought? Papers ought to make use in some way of phenomenological methodology. Abstracts of up to 500 words or completed papers should be sent to apacentral@sophere.org by August 1.</p>

			<title>[ May 30, 2025 -  June 7, 2025] Conference or similar: BACK to the THINGS THEMSELVES! 2025</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/123722</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p><em>Back to the Things Themselves!</em> (<em>BTTTT!</em>) is an annual attempt to put aside the more conventional scholarly practice of textual exegesis and critique, and return to the lived world to divine the essential structures of experience through careful phenomenological description.</p>
<p>In short, <em>BTTTT!</em>‘s main aim is to “do phenomenology”—that is, to generate original descriptions of phenomena in the lifeworld. </p>
<p><em>BTTTT!</em> is part of the Society for Existential and Phenomenological Theory and Culture (EPTC), which meets annually and concurrently with the Canadian Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences in late May or early June. </p></description>

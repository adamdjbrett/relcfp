			<title>[ June 17, 2024 -  June 19, 2024] Conference or similar: Between Past and Future: Existence, Embodiment, and Historicity</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/119166</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/><p>Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway </p>
<p>June 17–19, 2024</p>
<p>Confirmed keynote speakers: Charlotta Weigelt (Södertörn University), Jan Slaby (Freie Universität Berlin), Thomas Schwarz Wentzer (Aarhus University), Lisa Guenther (Queen’s University Canada) </p>
<p>Humans are historical beings. We live through, and interpret ourselves in the light of, our differing traditions, even when we are not aware of this fact. We may experience such traditions as traditions of power, domination, and suppression, but also as sources of inspiration and potential liberation from the present. At the same time all of us “have” our own history: we are born, we grow older, and eventually we die, and who we were at one time, as individuals and as parts of a community, affect what we are and are capable of becoming. Our past is, it may therefore be argued, ambiguous, and our future may depend on the way we appropriate and question our past. </p>
<p>We also tend to deny the historicity of our existence, a tendency that may come to expression in a variety of ways. We may attempt to break radically with the past, to “move on,” and to regard past traditions merely as objects of theoretical inquiry with at most an antiquarian relevance for contemporary society and life. And we may try to hide from the biological fact that human beings age and change, be that through pursuing “eternal youth” or by tacitly denying the right of older generations to take part in discussions of contemporary problems on a par with younger generations. In short, we tend to concentrate on the present while disregarding our past and its significance for the future.  </p>
<p>We hereby invite abstracts for papers in phenomenology and related areas of philosophy, such as critical theory, feminist philosophy, queer theory, and the post-Kantian tradition widely conceived. This year we especially encourage work that addresses the way historicity affects our existence, as embodied individuals and as communities. Questions to be addressed include, but are not limited to, the following: What can past traditions teach us when it comes to addressing contemporary problems such as the ecological crisis or the apparent decline in democratic sentiments? Are categories from past traditions a help or a hindrance for coming to grips with such problems? How is fruitful dialogue between differing traditions and cultures possible and how does cultural appropriation differ from genuine dialogue? How do traditions in science influence our conceptions of rationality? Can traditions within art, religion, and other cultural spheres help us reach a more comprehensive understanding of human rationality? How should we understand the connection between past traditions and radical new beginnings or truth-disclosing experiences, for instance in art?  </p></description>

						<description>Publication Name: Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900): Ways In and Out of the Labyrinth<br/><br/><p><a href="https://www.axiapublishers.com/ojs/index.php/labyrinth/index"><em>Labyrinth: An International Journal for Philosophy, Value Theory and Sociocultural Hermeneutics</em></a> is preparing a special issue on the occasion of the 180. anniversary of the birth of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) – one of the most controversial philosophers.</p>
<p>"One day my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous — of a crisis like no other on earth, of the deepest collision of conscience, of a decision conjured up against everything that had been believed, demanded, sanctified until then. I'm not human, I 'm dynamite. — And with all this there is nothing in me from a religion founder — religions are mob affairs." This is how Nietzsche prophetically described the explosive force of his philosophical essays and aphorisms. He was not mistaken in this respect, for his critical thinking brought about the dawn of a new philosophical age and had also a decisive influence on the literature and the socio-political thought of the 20th century. While Nietzsche regarded himself as a "free spirit" (<em>Freigeist</em>), after his death he was ideologically used and abused by both, the right and the left, and often presented as a "nihilist," "anarchist" or even a "forerunner of fascism". Almost all leading philosophers of the 20th century have written on Nietzsche, and many of the core issues of his work are still relevant for the current epistemological, religious, axiological, ethical and sociopolitical debates.</p>
<p>Nietzsche's philosophy is of particular interest to Labyrinth, our journal, in that he portrayed modernity as a labyrinth of false virtues and "moral acid", and the modern human being as ill "from lazy peace, from cowardly compromise, from the whole virtuous uncleanliness of modern Yes and No." At the same time, he depicted the labyrinth as a testing room for the noble and the strong, the Übermensch, where he could develop his extraordinary capacities and find happiness. "The most spiritual human beings, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in severity towards themselves and others, in attempting." Hence, the title "Ways In and Out of the Labyrinth" suggests, first, that Nietzsche not only criticized modernity, but also showed the ways to overcome it, and second, that his entire work can be seen as an effort in this direction.</p>
<p>Labyrinth seeks papers on new readings and discussions dealing with the main topics of Nietzsche's philosophy and its contemporary receptions, as for example:</p>
<p>·       The will to power and the revaluation of all values</p>
<p>·       Values, ideals, and the feelings of guilt</p>
<p>·       Nihilism as loss of sense and values</p>
<p>·       The Übermensch and the masses</p>
<p>·       Critique of the subject and deconstruction of identity</p>
<p>·       Truth, illusion, lie, and mistrust</p>
<p>·       Perspective and interpretation</p>
<p>·       Criticism of science and religion as closed systems</p>
<p>·       The idea of the "eternal return of the same"</p>
<p>·       "Master morality" and "slave morality"</p>
<p>·       Art as liberation and life design</p>
<p>·       Political perspectives of Nietzsche's philosophy</p>
<p>·       Nietzsche in the context of phenomenology and hermeneutics</p>
<p>·       Poststructuralist and postmodernist interpretations of Nietzsche</p>
<p>·       Nietzsche and Feminist Critique</p>
<p>Researchers working on Nietzsche are invited to submit a brief abstract until the 25 of February 2024 with a brief biographic information including name, academic affiliation, and main publications.</p>
<p>Authors who have already a finished unpublished paper are welcome to submit it within the abstract in order to help the peer review and the publishing process. Papers in their final form, i.e., proofread, formatted according to the journal guidelines and print ready, should be submitted no later than the 28 of July 2024. </p>
<p>As a multilingual Journal <em>Labyrinth</em> accepts papers in English, French, and German. For more information about the journal policies and the submission's guidelines please visit: <a href="https://www.axiapublishers.com/ojs/index.php/labyrinth/AuthorGuidelines">https://www.axiapublishers.com/ojs/index.php/labyrinth/AuthorGuidelines</a></p>
<p>All abstracts and papers should be sent to labyrinth [at] axiapublishers.com</p></description>

Given this year’s conference location at a Jesuit, Catholic university, and our keynote speakers, we particularly (but not exclusively) invite submissions focused on regions other than England, including the Middle East; language traditions other than English; and religious cultures. </p>
<p>We interpret “transgressions” broadly, including the notions of access, trespass, and desire. Accordingly, we welcome papers from medievalists in any discipline, concerned with any region or polity of Europe, Asia, or Africa. Papers might consider any of the following subtopics, or others: </p>
<ul>
<li>bookswhoseform,content,orprovenanceistransgressive;</li>
<li>textual cultures: books, authors, texts, audience expectations;</li>
<li>the codification of law and law-books;</li>
<li>transgression and sin in medieval philosophy and theology;</li>
<li>
<p>etiquette, diplomacy, or cultural norms, or remediations or contestations of these in written </p>
<p>texts;</p></li>
<li>
<p>stylistic norms (e.g., poetic and rhetorical precepts) and their transgressions in writing or the </p>
<p>visual arts;</p></li>
<li>modern theoretical or methodological approaches to medieval texts;</li>
<li>vernacularity in literature, religion, or the visual arts as a mediation of cultural transgression;</li>
<li>the transgressive potential of medieval studies in the present day;</li>
<li>heterodoxy, heresy, or the function of the written word in regulating the boundaries of orthodoxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>We invite abstracts for 20-minute papers. Please send abstracts of 300 words to <a href="mailto:medieval2024@gmail.com">medieval2024@gmail.com</a> by 15 June 2024. </p>
<p>Our keynote speakers are Dr. Ariane Bottex-Ferragne and Dr. Ahmed El Shamsy. Professor Bottex-Ferragne is Assistant Professor of French at New York University. Her presentation is provisionally entitled “Rules of Transgression in Medieval Poetry: Lessons from a Forgotten Bestseller.” Professor El Shamsy is Professor of Islamic Thought at the University of Chicago. His presentation is provisionally entitled “Authors and their Audiences in Medieval Arabic Book Culture.” </p>
<p>The 2024 conference marks the quinquagenary (fiftieth anniversary) of the founding of the NEMC. As the conference returns to Boston College for the first time since 1981, we hope to make it an especially festive occasion. With our theme of “Books and Transgressions” and with our two invited keynotes, we also propose to expand, geographically, disciplinarily, linguistically, and conceptually, what “the Middle Ages” has signified to our colleagues and students. </p>
<p>Boston College is located in Chestnut Hill, MA, and is easily accessible by car, plane, or bus.

In his extant fragments, Democritus claims that the poet writes by divine inspiration (fr. 17) and that Homer's greatness is due to his godlike nature (fr. 21). But the great systematiser of this doctrine is undoubtedly Plato, in dialogues such as the <em>Phaedrus</em>, <em>The Laws</em> and, above all, the <em>Ion</em>: the poet's art cannot be explained by craftsmanship, but by a divine rapture of which the poet remains ignorant. This notion had a long history in Antiquity, and is reformulated in the works of Cicero, Horatius, Seneca or Statius, among others. In the Middle Ages, <em>furor poeticus</em> was easily assimilated into Christian categories, leading to the ideology of the poet as a "scriba Dei" in authors such as Alain de Lille or Dante Alighieri.</p>
<p>With the revival of Neoplatonism in Western Europe, the humanists of the fifteenth century took up the teachings of Plato and adapted them to the needs of their own time. Coluccio Salutati, Leonardo Bruni and other representatives of Florentine civic humanism provided the first modern reception of the idea, using Cicero and Isidore of Seville as primary sources. It was Marsilio Ficino, translator and commentator on the <em>Ion</em>, who gave the concept its modern form. In his 1457 epistle <em>De Divino Furore</em> and in his treatise on <em>Theologia Platonica</em> (1482), Ficino identifies four types of divine inspiration ("furor divinus"), one of which is "furor poeticus": the divine power that possesses true literary creators. Ficino's followers, such as Poliziano or Landino, adopted the Platonic concept, but also raised the old problem of whether inspiration (<em>ingenium</em>) alone was sufficient, or whether it had to be combined with a mastery of poetic craftsmanship (<em>ars</em>).</p>
<p>The edited volume (under negotiation with a top international publisher) seeks to explore the afterlife of this poetological idea in modern literature and poetics in the broadest sense from sixteenth century to the present.</p>
<p>The edited volume invites essays on the following themes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>-<em>Furor poeticus</em> in the Renaissance and beyond: Ludovico Ariosto, Giordano Bruno, Marco Girolamo Vida, George Chapman, George Puttenham, John of the Cross and the mystics, the poets of La Pléiade… What are the links of these authors with Neoplatonism, Orphism, Christianity and other religions or spiritual movements?</p>
<p>-In eighteenth-century aesthetics, the concept of genius seems to take the place traditionally occupied by <em>furor poeticus</em>: Lord Shaftesbury, Edmund Burke, Edward Young, William Duff, Immanuel Kant...</p>
<p>-The Romantic appropriation of the idea of <em>furor poeticus</em> in authors such as Hölderlin, Hamann, Coleridge, Blake, De Quincey. Divine rapture turns into personal madness.</p>
<p>-Secularisations of <em>furor poeticus</em> from the nineteenth century onwards: Schopenhauer interprets it as a mental illness and Freud as adult daydreams that replace child's play.</p>
<p>-Presences of <em>furor poeticus</em> in contemporary literary theory: Harold Bloom's concept of "influence" or Angus Fletcher's concept of "allegory".</p>
<p>-Reception and transformation of the idea in contemporary writers: Antonin Artaud, Ted Hughes, Anne Sexton, Leopoldo María Panero… Comparative approaches are also welcome.</p>
<p>Please submit your proposal title and a 600-800 words abstract together with a short CV including current affiliation, academic position, ORCID and main publications. All essays, written in English, must be original and unpublished.</p>
<p>Abstracts should be emailed by 15 March 2024 to <a href="mailto:furorpoeticuscall@gmail.com">furorpoeticuscall@gmail.com</a></p>

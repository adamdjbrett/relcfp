			<title>[Tomorrow] Talk or similar: Two Types of the Critique of Religion - Dieter Birnbacher</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/106585</link>
						<description>Venue: Unknown<br/><br/>Speakers at this event: <br/>Dieter Birnbacher (Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf)<br/><br/><p>Dear Colleague,<br/><br/>You are invited to participate in the next session of the Logic and Religion Webinar Series which will be held on <strong>January 12, 2023</strong>, at <strong>4pm CET</strong> with the topic:</p>
<p><strong>TWO TYPES OF CRITIQUE OF RELIGION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Dieter Birnbacher (University of Düsseldorf, Germany)</p>
<p><strong>Chair</strong>: Jens Lemanski (University of Hagen, Germany)</p>
<p>Please, register in advance to receive the zoom link:<br/>https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars</p>
<p> <br/>Abstract: The talk distinguishes three main directions in the philosophical criticism of religion and  exemplifies them by the critique of religion contained in Schopenhauer’s Dialogue on religion: the inherent inability of religions to reveal the mythical nature of the objects of religious worship; the authoritarian nature of observing religious prescriptions; the allegation that religion produces more evil than good. On the last point, however, Schopenhauer is ambivalent: religion, to him, is the “philosophy of the masses” containing more than a grain of truth but in a form adapted to their seemingly limited intellectual capacities.</p>
<p>Join us 5 minutes prior to the beginning of the session!<br/> <br/>With best wishes,</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>Francisco de Assis Mariano <br/>The University of Missouri-Columbia<br/>LARA Secretary<br/>lara@logicandreligion.com</p></description>

Just as the forms of religious and spiritual activity change, the concept of a pilgrimage can be defined in different ways. Often this term is used to describe an exceptional travel to dedicated places of cultural and religious heritage, also without the presence of religious motivation. In this sense, a good example might be e.g. Camino de Santiago or the Holy Land. Sometimes a pilgrimage can be a travel to places related to famous people or cultural icons, like Memphis. We invite all researchers to submit talks and participate in the panel for studying the narrations of modern pilgrims, travel literature about places important (not only) for various religious traditions, as well as different aspects of experience learnt by pilgrims or religious tourists, analyses of their memories and travel reports, and finally cultural tourism that can be considered as religious pilgrimages.</p><p>We are looking for additional panelists interested in modern pilgrimage, cultural and religious tourism.</p><p>Submit your paper: <a href="mailto:pabloplichta@gmail.com">pabloplichta@gmail.com</a></p><p><span><span><span><span>Abstracts of no more than 300 words should be submitted no later than <strong>25 January, 2023</strong></span></span></span></span></p><p>Our panel takes place as part of the 6th Annual Conference of the European Academy of Religion in St Andrews, Scotland, UK, 19-23 Jun 2023.</p><p>The theme for this year’s gathering is Religion from the Inside, with keynote lectures planned by Prof. Jean-Luc Marion, Dr Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, Prof. Diwakar Acharya, Dr John Makransky, and Prof. Lejla Demiri. As in previous years, the conference programme will be composed of working sessions including: open panels; closed panels; book presentations; and keynote lectures focusing on the overarching topic, Religion from the Inside.</p><p>Religions join people in common endeavours, offer fulfilment and purpose to their adherents, and bind together the material and the immaterial. They can be described propositionally, but are whole ways of life. As such, religions have characteristics which may be clear to those within, but which are difficult to grasp for those without: inhabiting a building is different to looking over its blueprints. The examination of what is added (and what is lost) by taking the inside view is the theme of this year's annual meeting.</p><p>Religion from the Inside looks different in different religious traditions. Within some, the inside view is engaged mainly with questions of theology: the contemplation of the divine and all things in relation thereto. Within others, it is preoccupied with the conforming of human action to a more-than-human law. In yet other, an emic perspective focuses on the practice and experience of ritual. Reflection on sacred texts is common to many traditions, and often differs from external consideration of the same documents. Acknowledging the existence of emic knowledge can be an invitation to exploration and relationship rather than a method of isolation.</p><p>​Panel participating in the theme may choose to explore whether and how emic insights can be articulated in propositional form accessible to etic readers. They may engage with distinctively emic epistemologies, such as narrative traditions or second-person knowledge, which cast religious belief less as an intellectual acceptance of propositions than as an entry into a relationship. They may also discuss empirical questions of the differences religious faith or practice makes to perception, psychology, or individual and communal life. Equally, panels may examine the risks of insulated perspectives, including the exclusionary thrust of strong distinctions between insider and outsider, and the repudiation of common standards of truth.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Pawel Plichta: <a href="mailto:pabloplichta@gmail.com">pabloplichta@gmail.com</a></p><p>Barbara Wezgowiec: <a href="mailto:chopinka@poczta.fm">chopinka@poczta.fm</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:pabloplichta@gmail.com">pabloplichta@gmail.com</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.europeanacademyofreligion.org/conference-schedule" target="_blank">https://www.europeanacademyofreligion.org/conference-schedule</a></div></div></div></description>

<p>Call for Submissions Deadline: February 10, 2023</p>
<p>One of the challenges faced by translators of Arabic literary texts into English concerns the approaches used in rendering embedded religious content and allusions. In this panel, we invite presentations that focus on the strategies used by translators to convey the meaning of religious expressions, allusions, and symbols in a manner that takes into consideration the compatibility between the linguistic and conceptual planes. We would also like to address the strategies that translators of Arabic literature use to find equivalence and substitutes for particular Qur’anic connotations and implications in the source language and culture and their counterparts in the target language and culture.</p>
<p>In this AATA panel held in conjunction with MESA’s 57th annual meeting on November 2-5, 2023, in Montréal, Canada, we would like to focus on the rhetorical strategies and linguistic choices used in translating religious allusions and expressions in Arabic literature in English in relation to the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>• Strategies of semantic and syntactic approximations</li>
<li>• Adaptation and naturalization of culturally specific expressions</li>
<li>• Cultural, pragmatic and text specific problems</li>
<li>• Idiomatic expressions with religious allusions</li>
<li>• Functional equivalents and cultural substitutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We invite presenters interested in presenting on any of these or similar issues relevant to the panel topic to send a 300-word abstract and a short bio by <strong>Friday, February 10, 2023</strong>, to <strong><a href="mailto:aatapanel@gmail.com">aatapanel@gmail.com</a></strong></p>
<p>Accepted presentations should be delivered in Arabic.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br/>Stone is a durable, lasting medium. Even in its fragmentation, it exudes permanence, solidity, and symbolism. For millennia, humans have shaped stone, fashioning it into architectural wonders, sculptured monuments, objects of lived religion, and things of everyday use. At the same time, natural stonescapes, from caves and mountains to canyons and valleys, have played indisputable roles in the shaping of human experience and expression. Natural and hewn stone has long been used, reused, repurposed, and recycled in myriad contexts, at local, regional, and global levels. To this end, this session explores human relationships to stone from both historical and archaeological perspectives. It invites scholars of all time periods and geographies, but especially those working from the prehistoric to the medieval periods, to contribute papers exploring the experience of stone. Possible subjects include, but are not limited to: stone and the landscape; a phenomenology of stone; agentive stone; stone and lived religion; the theology of stone; the materiality of stone; the reuse of hewn or sculptured stone; the relationship of stone artifacts to ecofacts; stone and memory; or, shaping stone into space. Above all else, this session seeks to open a dialogue between eras, disciplines, methodologies, and geographies, with the particular aim of bringing archaeologists and historians into further conversation with one another.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong><br/>stone, phenomenology, sculpture and architecture, landscape archaeology, material culture, monumentality</p>

<p><em>Mormonism in Romantic and Victorian Print Culture</em></p>
<p>(Edited by Abby Clayton and Colby Townsend)</p>
<p>Coming on the heels of what is traditionally viewed as the Romantic period and bleeding into the Victorian, Mormonism serves as a lens through which to understand the diverse innovations in print culture during the long nineteenth century. Mormonism—not only a religious, but also a cultural and textual phenomenon—utilized a transatlantic print network almost from its moment of inception. Paradoxically, the same network exponentially multiplied the movement’s growth by reacting to and against its existence. These print systems became embodied as they moved people from the United Kingdom and continental Europe to the American West. The migration of bodies and texts through Mormonism staged key transatlantic nineteenth-century debates including questions about empire, indigenous peoples, gender and sexuality, authorship and composition, forms of prophecy, and religious canons.  </p>
<p>The editors seek essays that re-envision transatlantic Romantic and Victorian print networks through a consideration of Mormon or Mormon-inspired texts and culture. We invite contributors to analyze this period through a variety of literary, historical, and cultural methodologies. We aim to be inclusive in this volume through readings of lesser-known authors of the long nineteenth century, new readings of canonical texts, and treatments of religious movements as sites of political inquiry. This volume re-conceives literature as not just books and novels, but newspapers, tracts, pamphlets, and other print ephemera that are grounded in their materiality and their use in everyday situations by diverse readers and listeners. We invite interdisciplinary, transnational, and intersectional approaches to the question of religion and literature. </p>
<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Materiality of print and book history</li>
<li>Print ephemera, including railway yellow-backs, looseleaf and magazine extras</li>
<li>History of the novel, including satires, gothic, historical romances, and the “Oriental” tale</li>
<li>Reprinting and pirating culture</li>
<li>Myth of the author</li>
<li>Politics, French Revolution, Anti-Jacobinism, Democracy, Imperialism, and the Subaltern</li>
<li>Representations of Mormonism in print media and Anti-Mormon literature</li>
<li>Lost manuscripts found, ghosts and guardian spirits</li>
<li>The fantastic and the sublime in Romantic, Victorian, and Mormon texts</li>
<li>Form, genre, and narrative theory in 18C and 19C print culture</li>
<li>Gender, minorities, and the “Other” in 18C and 19C texts, including voice and literacy</li>
<li>The problems of scripture and canon in literary criticism</li>
<li>Disability in 18C and 19C print culture</li>
<li>The challenges of locating disability in already contested archives (e.g. slavery, colonialism, etc.)</li>
<li>Oratory, eloquence, and sermon culture</li>
<li>Time and Critical Geographies</li>
<li>Text, image, and credulity in the long nineteenth century</li>
<li>Digital archives and Romantic, Victorian, and Mormon manuscripts</li>
<li>Romantic, Victorian, and Mormon poetry</li>
<li>Portrayals of polygamy in history</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome submissions from professors, adjunct or contingent faculty, independent scholars, post-docs, and graduate students working in a variety of fields, including history, religion, literature, and others in the humanities. Please submit abstracts (300–500 words), an abbreviated CV, and a short bio to editors Abby Clayton (<a href="mailto:aclayto@iu.edu">aclayto@iu.edu</a>) and Colby Townsend (<a href="mailto:colbtown@iu.edu">colbtown@iu.edu</a>) by April 1, 2023.

Kristin M.S. Bezio (University of Richmond) and Samantha Dressel (Chapman University).</p>
<p> The issue have proposed a final deadline of fall 2023 for publication, and we are asking for abstract proposals by March 1, 2023. Assuming all proposed abstracts fit the theme, we are hoping for initial drafted chapters by 1 July 2023 to allow time for revisions and editing before entering the production process. Final chapters will be due to Religions for peer review, etc., by 15 October 2023.</p>
<p> We are inviting essays that pertain, broadly speaking, to the ideas of spectacle, ritual, and drama as it relates to questions or practice of religion. We are particularly interested in essays that include global, non-white (or not only white), and non-Anglocentric (or not only Anglocentric) perspectives. </p>
<p>Spectacle lies at the heart of both ritual and drama, and religion is often similarly to be found at the core of both. Whether a spectacle is tied to ritualized praxis, to celebration or mourning, or to the production of a dramatic performance, elements of religious culture are often foregrounded, particularly in the medieval and early modern world.</p>
<p> This Special Issue aims to showcase essays that discuss the impact and depictions of religious belief and conflict in public ritual and drama throughout the medieval and early modern periods. Specifically, the issue seeks essays that cross multiple boundaries, whether religious, cultural, social, or geographical in terms of their depictions of public spectacle, whether religious, dramatic, or both. Essays in this volume should also consider the importance of their argument’s focus to larger questions of inclusion, equity, and diversity, either within the period or relative to more contemporary discussions, whether in the classroom or in the wider world. </p>
<p> In this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome. Research areas may include (but are not limited to) the following: religious studies, theology, literature and drama, history, art history, musicology, archaeology, or another relevant field. We ask for articles that focus on the middle ages through the early modern period (understood as flexible based on the region(s) under consideration) and specifically pertain to the focal topic of the special issue (religions in ritual, spectacle, and drama).</p>
<p>Please submit abstracts directly to Drs. Bezio &amp; Dressel (<a href="mailto:kbezio@richmond.edu">kbezio@richmond.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:sdressel@chapman.edu">sdressel@chapman.edu</a>) before March 1, 2023. The editors will evaluate abstracts and respond promptly with an invitation to submit chapters within two weeks of the deadline.</p>

<p>Editors: Muhammad Safdar</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Muslims were tolerant of queer genders and were condemned by Medieval Western intellectuals for it. However, modern secular Western polemics of individual human rights and autonomy condemn them for being oppressive. South Asia is home to the world’s largest Muslim population with a variety of religious schools of thought. South Asian Muslimness and their behaviors to <em>khawaja sira </em>and<em> hijra</em> genders/sex have been an interesting case to study intersectionality of Muslimness and queer gender tendencies/practices in a subject because of an intriguing diversity in the behaviors over time and space from being highly regarding, accommodative, moderate, conservative and oppressive. Literatures produced by South Asian Muslims in different languages have engaged with non-normative genders and intimacies including <em>khawaja</em> <em>sira</em> and <em>hijra</em> subjects depicting an enriched variety of their social status/places and ‘lived’ experiences over a history of hundreds of years of the presence and practices of <em>interpretations</em> of Islam in the region. Especially, recently, Pakistani and Bangladeshi Anglophone literatures have attracted international critical scholarly attention for being growingly transgressive in engaging with non-normative genders in the contexts of reignited grappling between secular and religious discourses, charged religiosity, intense cross-(b)orders mobility, compressing/fraying spatial and cultural distinctions, globalization, neoliberalism and resurgent far-right popular masculinist religio-nationalist politics in the region.</p>
<p>Muslim queerness cannot be homogenized into the category of ‘queer of color’ and, further, South Asian Muslim queernesses cannot be reduced and homogenized into Muslim queerness. There are subtle and nuanced institutional, geopolitical, temporal, spatial, individual, affective and humanist distinctions intersected by religious interpretations and nationalisms which require scholarly attention to be explored and examined to foreground Muslim queer imaginaries and underline the struggles, resistance and negotiations of Muslim queers in their historical specificities in South Asia. While reading the intersectionality of Muslimness and queer gender/sexual subjectivity as depicted in South Asian literatures, the aim of this edited book volume is to bring into the limelight Muslim queer marginalities from within queerness of color in South Asia which is in itself on margins in the Western canonical polemics of queerness. Its objectives are to explore 1) Muslim concepts about and Muslimness of queer gender/sex. 2) Muslim queer subjects, subjectivation and subjectivities. 3) Temporal, spatial, social and political shifts in the imaginaries and subjectivities of/about queers intersected by shifts in religious interpretations/understandings or politico-religious praxis to define gender and sexual moralities.</p>
<p>It intends to read South Asian literary inscriptions of Muslim queer imaginaries, temporalities and subjects from a decolonial perspective which critiques the epistemological violence of Euro-America-centric universalism along with underlining the violence of local heteronormative gender/sexual moralities defined by shifts in religious thoughts.</p>
<p>Though all South Asian religions have had an important role in defining gender moralities, this book focuses on how Muslimness has particularly been implicated in an essential intersecting role to define and shape the lives of trans, <em>khawaja sira</em> and <em>hijra</em>.</p>
<p>It invites original contributions in English in the form of critical essays which explore the complexities of South Asian Muslim queer imaginaries and subjects as depicted in literatures written by Muslim or non-Muslim writers of South Asian origin in English or any other regional language. It particularly wants its essays to critically engage in a dialogue with Euro-American universalist and local heteronormative theoretical frames to point out their reductiveness and limits, and to foreground distinctive decolonial and resistive epistemological subtlety(ies) to read South Asian Muslim queer imaginaries and subjects by examining their distinctive complexities and situatedness in which religion is an essential defining element amongst other intersecting factors. It wants its essays to examine how religious trajectories have recognized/derecognized, oppressed/emancipated/rescued, neglected, tolerated, accepted, turned a blind eye to, enabled/disabled and empowered Muslim queers. It also wants its contributors to be self-reflexive and conscious of their researcher positionality while reading the queer.</p>
<p>The essays may focus on either of (but not limited to) the following thematic areas reflected in South Asian literatures:</p>
<p>Typology of Muslim queer imaginary</p>
<p>Transitions in the constructions of Muslim queer imaginary and subjects</p>
<p>Subjectivation and subjectivities of Muslim queers</p>
<p>Social and political status of <em>khawaja sira</em>, <em>hijra</em> and trans</p>
<p>Political erasure and rendering non-subjects of certain queer desires and subjective groundings</p>
<p>Selective acceptance and tolerance of queer experiences</p>
<p>Groundings of Muslims’ behaviors towards queers</p>
<p>Elevation of <em>khawaja sira</em> and <em>hijra</em> to high social and political posts and perspectives behind it</p>
<p>Contemporary Muslim queer politics</p>
<p>Strategic potential and limitations of religious/secular approaches to ensure rights of queers</p>
<p>Diasporic Muslim queer subjects</p>
<p>Narratives and perspectives of queers towards religion regarding their queer subjectivities</p>
<p>Intersectionality or mutual exclusiveness of religion and non-heteronormative intimacies/desires in a queer subject</p>
<p>We are inviting abstracts (350 words along with a bionote of 50 words in a single MS Word file) by January 31, 2023. Kindly send your abstract to <a href="mailto:msnbajwa@gmail.com">msnbajwa@gmail.com</a></p>

Kristin M.S. Bezio (University of Richmond) and Samantha Dressel (Chapman University).</p><p> The issue have proposed a final deadline of fall 2023 for publication, and we are asking for abstract proposals by March 1, 2023. Assuming all proposed abstracts fit the theme, we are hoping for initial drafted chapters by 1 July 2023 to allow time for revisions and editing before entering the production process. Final chapters will be due to Religions for peer review, etc., by 15 October 2023.</p><p> We are inviting essays that pertain, broadly speaking, to the ideas of spectacle, ritual, and drama as it relates to questions or practice of religion. We are particularly interested in essays that include global, non-white (or not only white), and non-Anglocentric (or not only Anglocentric) perspectives. </p><p>Spectacle lies at the heart of both ritual and drama, and religion is often similarly to be found at the core of both. Whether a spectacle is tied to ritualized praxis, to celebration or mourning, or to the production of a dramatic performance, elements of religious culture are often foregrounded, particularly in the medieval and early modern world.</p><p>This Special Issue aims to showcase essays that discuss the impact and depictions of religious belief and conflict in public ritual and drama throughout the medieval and early modern periods. Specifically, the issue seeks essays that cross multiple boundaries, whether religious, cultural, social, or geographical in terms of their depictions of public spectacle, whether religious, dramatic, or both. Essays in this volume should also consider the importance of their argument’s focus to larger questions of inclusion, equity, and diversity, either within the period or relative to more contemporary discussions, whether in the classroom or in the wider world. </p><p> In this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome. Research areas may include (but are not limited to) the following: religious studies, theology, literature and drama, history, art history, musicology, archaeology, or another relevant field. We ask for articles that focus on the middle ages through the early modern period (understood as flexible based on the region(s) under consideration) and specifically pertain to the focal topic of the special issue (religions in ritual, spectacle, and drama).</p><p>Please submit abstracts directly to Drs. Bezio &amp; Dressel (<a href="mailto:kbezio@richmond.edu">kbezio@richmond.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:sdressel@chapman.edu">sdressel@chapman.edu</a>) before March 1, 2023. The editors will evaluate abstracts and respond promptly with an invitation to submit chapters within two weeks of the deadline.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:kbezio@richmond.edu">kbezio@richmond.edu</a></div></div></div></description>

Take, for instance, the current focus on Ukrainian refugees and how they have been received differently than Syrian refugees. While in the latter case, we are told of a “refugee crisis,” the former is perceived as a duty Europe owes to Ukrainians because they are Europeans. In other words, Ukrainians “belong” in Europe.The present moment, therefore, calls for a historization and reimagination of major concepts in our debates about belonging. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>To complicate this concept, we turn to interdisciplinary work that employs ideas of translation, kinship, exile, and diaspora to expose the elasticity of “belonging.” For instance, we ask what understandings of belonging have contributed to the hostile discourse we witness regarding immigration? How might politicians have shaped this discourse? Some scholars, such as Keguro Macharia, have named how political leaders rely on biological kinship and other “genealogical models to generate social and cultural legibility,” to gird up national collective identity and sympathies. Yet, in doing so, they often perniciously privilege “reproductive heteronormativity” at the expense of other forms of belonging or relationality. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We may also think of exile and diaspora as an alternative site that complicates our theorizing of belonging. In </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Reflections on Exile and Other Essays</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, Edward Said writes, “Exile is… the unbearable rift forced between a human being and a native place, between the self and its true home: its essential sadness can never be surmounted.” One interpretation of this statement might suggest that Said is reinforcing an idea that one only belongs to their place of birth or their “native place.” What might be a way to think about exile beyond this notion of “insurmountable uprootedness”? Following Mary Jacobus, we consider whether belonging must be intimately bound up with a notion of a past home. Her use of “translation” as a mode of analysis highlights how, far from simply being an instance of moving “from one language to another,” translation is also moving “from one place to another–translocation.” Translation enables the experience of “becoming foreign” that gestures toward a cosmopolitan vision of a world without borders. Thus, rather than exploring a melancholic return to the past home, what might be produced when we take, as Nadia Ellis suggests, an utopian diasporic horizon as our imaginary for belonging? </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The 10th annual Dean Hopper Conference of Spring 2023 (March 24) will examine these and related questions, seeking interdisciplinary engagements with the notion of “belonging” in cultural, historical, political, and theoretical contexts. We invite papers engaging with the intellectual and cultural history of belonging, and related topics like home, kinships, translation, exile, migration, both from historians and other scholars and from activists working in the field. Submissions from graduate students, postdocs, and early-career faculty are encouraged. This year’s conference will be hybrid in its modality; as such, we also welcome submissions from individuals to present via Zoom as well as in-person. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Please send abstracts to </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="mailto:Hopper@drew.edu"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Hopper@drew.edu</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> by 11 January 2023:</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> The conference organizers welcome abstracts of no more than 250 words, and panel proposals of not more than 750 words.

			<title>[ April 15, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: UCSIA Summer School: 'God on our side? Questioning Theological Narratives of Nationalism, Populism &amp; Conservatism'</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/121694</link>
						<description><p>The UCSIA Summer School is a free one-week mentoring programme that encourages doctoral and postdoctoral students to explore interdisciplinary ways of analysing the relationship between religion, culture and society. Key elements of the programme are expert lectures, paper presentations by the students and individual tutoring by the faculty. The UCSIA Summer School 2024, titled <em>God on Our Side? Questioning Theological Narratives of Nationalism, Populism and Conservatism</em>, marks the start of a three-year cycle of summer schools, focused on the entanglements of religion and politics, the communities in which they take shape and function, and the injustices they entail or critique.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, new forms of nationalism, populism and conservatism are emerging. They take shape at the intersection of historical, geopolitical, socio-economic as well as religious developments and discourses, with theological justifications of nationalist discourses playing an important role in the framing of national identities and the ‘Other’. An analysis of such ‘theological nationalism’ and religiously inspired politics is crucial to discerning the religious dimensions of contemporary politics and their global resonance.</p>
<p>Concepts of theological and political nature have always been reciprocally negotiated; their entangled histories have shaped and continue to shape communities and societies in practice, with diverging concrete effects. By bringing the different disciplines of the human sciences into dialogue with theology, this summer school will explore the dynamic exchange of concepts, ideas and assumptions between the theological and the political realm, that contribute to constructing a nationalist identity. Furthermore, attention will be paid to the racialization of religion, theological and religious nationalism, populism and conservatism and economic theologies. At the other end of the political spectrum, certain forms of socialism and solidarity are based on (secularized) religious or spiritual concepts such as ‘progress’, which – according to Karl Löwith – is the modern, secularized guise of the Christian theological concept of ‘hope’.</p>
<p>Doctoral and postdoctoral students with a research interest in religion are invited to apply to the summer school by submitting a research paper. Papers may address, but are not limited to the following questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is theological or religious nationalism?</li>
<li>What accounts for its rise in different parts of the world? What issues does it respond to?</li>
<li>How do we understand theologically and socially scientifically the operation of theological ideas outside the realm of their institutions?</li>
<li>How is theological and religious nationalism intertwined with political trends of populism and conservatism?</li>
<li>How can we distinguish nationalist, populist or conservative theological-political discourses?</li>
<li>How do different scientific disciplines interpret public and political theology in these contexts?</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on the programme and application procedure is available via www.ucsia-summerschool.org </p></description>

We wish to explore multiple articulations and evidence of sameness through sound, image, text, performance, active recollection, and memory, in the context of increased otherisation. We are therefore interested in papers, which explore junctures, events, overlaps, and nodes, situated across time and space, which act as vestibules between the idea of “Muslimness” and “belonging”. Conceptions of Muslim belonging may not only be appended to notions of religiosity, but also explore linkages with class, caste, gender, hegemonies, place making, pioneership, and rootedness. The aim is to move beyond problematising the ills of authority and representation / mis-representation and invest in narratives which are first-person, self-reflexive, and agency specific. We look forward to hearing from early career scholars, advanced doctoral candidates as well as established academics from a range of disciplines, including but not limited to, ethnomusicology, film and media studies, history, literary studies, gender studies, sociology, anthropology, law and governance, economics, and performance studies. <strong>Abstract submission link: </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1k8Az6NuUvf7Zdhb3dtFzhjgkGUB15rRILZRW2sTVlMA/edit">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1k8Az6NuUvf7Zdhb3dtFzhjgkGUB15rRILZRW2sTVlMA/edit</a> <strong>Please send an abstract in about 150-200 words and a brief bio by 2 April, 2024 to <a href="mailto:soufieshahwar11@g.ucla.edu">soufieshahwar11@g.ucla.edu</a></strong></p>

In doing so, this forum builds on the foundation laid by a previous special forum titled <em>Redefining the American in Asian American Studies</em>, published in <em>JTAS</em> in 2012. That issue was part of a shift toward transnational perspectives in Asian American Studies that, in turn, influenced the development of the concept of “global Asias.” Meanwhile, scholars of comparative philosophy and comparative religion have begun to draw attention to how Asian American philosophical and religious practices in the United States are often obscured by the imprint of a binary racial politics upon religious discourse in the US. <em>Transnational Circuits of Asian Religio-Philosophy</em> brings together these two academic trends in order to consider how the reception of Asian religio-philosophy, broadly construed as religious and/or philosophical, in the US has shaped the meaning of both “Asian” and “American” as racial, cultural, political, and economic signifiers. </p>
<p>Tracing Asian thought over American cultural movements reveals apparent contradictions between the status of Asian religio-philosophy as countercultural and the racialization of Asian subjects as docile and assimilable. These contradictions demand critical investigation into a larger question of how Asian religio-philosophy and its reception can reveal points of imbrication between “global Asias” and transnational American studies. Relatedly, how and under what circumstances do Asian ideas and bodies travel to and in the Americas? How are ideas and bodies abstracted from one another and reified into American ideals of non/conformism, and what are the political stakes of restoring their relations?</p>
<p>We understand “Asian religio-philosophy” expansively as ontoepistemology, thereby allowing us to consider not only traditional schools of thought (e.g., Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism) but to include more recent Asian intellectual and political movements such as Maoism, Ghandian non-violence, or the work of Byung-Chul Han. We invite contributions that further scholarship on the transpacific and transimperial contexts in which Asian thought circulates. Submissions might consider a variety of critical topics, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asian religio-philosophy and American civil rights movements (e.g., Gandhi &amp;amp; Black American movements, Asian American anti-war efforts, Buddhist monk as protest figure)</li>
<li>Asian religio-philosophy in or contra American political theory (e.g., Benjamin Franklin and Confucianism, Confucius Institutes and foreign relations)</li>
<li>The links between Asian religio-philosophy, imperialism(s), and political economies (e.g., critiques of/participation in capitalism, state religion and nationalist paradigms)</li>
<li>Asian American and BIPOC literary and artistic engagements with Asian ontoepistemologies (e.g., Ruth Ozeki, Tuan Andrew Nguyen, Agha Shahid Ali, Wu-Tang Clan, Alice Coltrane)</li>
<li>The commodification and abstraction of Asian religio-philosophy in global circulation (e.g., martial arts/<em>qi</em>/<em>chakra</em>, <em>fengshui</em>, popular science and philosophy)</li>
<li>The deracination and/or racialization of sound in American music and spiritualism (e.g., yoga, gongs, Hindustani and Carnatic music, John Cage, The Beatles)</li>
<li>The transnational investments of American literary movements (e.g., Transcendentalists, Beats, Golden Age Science Fiction)</li>
<li>The reinscription of disciplinary boundaries and the role of Asian religio-philosophy in shaping the definitions of “religion,” “philosophy,” and “thought”</li>
</ul>

The roles of religion and religious thought in early Black culture have often been understood within the dualistic frame of resistance whereby Christianity, the dominant religion of colonial and antebellum American society, is both employed by masters to subjugate the enslaved and employed by the slaved to resist their masters’ subjugation of them. Scholars have thus considered the ways early Black writers strategically utilized Christian discourse to expose the hypocrisy of a supposedly Christian slaveholding society and appeal to a white audience for their civic inclusion within American democracy. Overall, the assumptive logic of such studies has been to understand religion and religious thought as a rhetorical and critical medium or tool for articulating issues of race, rights, and inclusion.  </p>
<p>While such critical approaches are no doubt important, this special issue examines how early Black writers turned to religious concepts to not only critique but think outside of the boundaries of civic belonging. The editors invite essays that broaden our understanding of early Black religious culture (i.e., Christian, Islam, West African, transnational, etc.) at the intersection of literary studies, rhetorical studies, religious studies, and print culture prior to the Civil War. <strong>We are interested in both formal article-length contributions (6,000-8,000 words) and shorter essays on “Consider the Source” that highlight innovative or creative ways of reading/using primary-source documents (3,000-5,000 words).</strong></p>
<p> <strong>To submit, please email a CV and a 1,000 word summary of the contribution you propose to write by June 30</strong> to Kevin Pyon (<a href="mailto:kbp5545@psu.edu">kbp5545@psu.edu</a>) and Don Holmes  (<a href="mailto:doh61@pitt.edu">doh61@pitt.edu</a>). Please use the subject line “Early African American Religion Special Issue Submission.” <strong>We will notify you of your preliminary acceptance by July 31, 2024 and final essays are due on December 31, 2024</strong>. Articles to be published are subject to peer review in 2025.</p>

Lewis and Last Things:</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>How the Writer of Narnia Saw the End of Our Story</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>4th November 2024</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>At Union Theological College</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Belfast, Northern Ireland</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Co-Sponsored by </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>The C.S. Lewis Institute Belfast </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>&amp; </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>John Brown University</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p> In <em>The Sense of an Ending, </em>literary critic Frank Kermode famously speaks of ‘our deep need for intelligible Ends’, saying that ‘We project ourselves [...] past the End, so as to see the structure whole, a thing we cannot do from our spot of time in the middle’. This one day public-facing symposium aims to examine<strong> </strong>C.S. Lewis’s vision(s) of <em>last things</em>, exploring his depictions of the end in works such as <em>The Narnia Chronicles</em>, <em>The Cosmic Trilogy</em> (or any of his fictional works), and to explore his <em>sense of the end</em> in his non-fiction: for example, in his essays, letters, or theological writings. We invite scholars at every career stage to engage with this broad topic from a variety of different and creative approaches to suit their own interests; and we invite them to consider—in a more general way— how Lewis’s talent for capturing abstract concepts in concrete, relatable terms might make him an especially capable guide in helping readers to make sense not merely of the end, but of the entirety of our story. </p>
<p><strong>Call for Papers</strong></p>
<p>We invite proposals of up to 250 words for 20-minute papers on some aspect of our topic. Submissions are welcome from scholars at every career stage, from early career researchers to well-established. Please include a brief bio with your submission. </p>
<p><strong>Email Proposals to: </strong></p>
<p>Curtis White at <a href="mailto:White-C36@ulster.ac.uk">White-C36@ulster.ac.uk</a> by 4th September 2024.</p>

Those aspiring to be on the panel should feel empowered to offer proposals that interpret the concept of religion rather loosely by potentially including the humanities and health as faith driven institutions. Maintaining a broad interpretation of religion to include all intersections of faith, folklore, belief, and literature; expressions of belief may include creeds, mottos, mission statements, charters, manifestos, doctrines, etc. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are accepting all proposals that explore the intersection of religion and literature. Papers that engage with the convention’s theme of “Health in/of the Humanities” are particularly welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please submit abstracts with title of no more than 250 words and a 50-word bio to Dr. Seth Johnson at <a href="mailto:swjohnson3@ua.edu">swjohnson3@ua.edu</a>, no later than <strong>April 15, 2024</strong>.</p>

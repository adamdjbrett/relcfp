Mark Koyama</strong> grew up in South East Asia and New Zealand before coming to live in the United States in 1980. He was educated at Bates College, Union Theological Seminary (MA 1992), University of Massachusetts Amherst (MFA 2010) and Yale Divinity School (MDiv 2015). Mark teaches literature and religious studies at Northfield Mount Hermon School and is the settled pastor at the United Church of Jaffrey, in Jaffrey, New Hampshire.</span></p><p><span><strong>Dr. Harriet Ward</strong> is a scientist and a Christian activist. Her doctorate from Brown University (1988) empowered her to serve infants and young children with vision loss, blindness and additional health and developmental challenges. Called by Christ to Antiracism work, Harriet is a powerful voice in the United Church of Christ where she has served on the Board of Directors of the National United Church of Christ and as Co-Chair of the Racial Justice Mission Group of the New Hampshire Conference. Harriet is a talented and inspired quilter. This comes naturally to her. She grew up making meals, clothing, rag rugs, and quilts out of scraps and leftovers.</span></p><p><span><strong>Kathy Barrett Blair</strong> is a lifelong resident of Keene, New Hampshire. With a degree in Occupational Therapy from UNH, she was the preschool occupational therapist for the Keene School District for 34 years. She chaired the NHCUCC Ukama Mission Group in partnership with UCC churches in Zimbabwe. Kathy designed and coordinated the renovation of UCC Keene’s Elsie Priest Park and children’s playground. She learned to sew in 4-H and continues to express her creativity through fabric, including the design and construction of Quilt #4 of the George Floyd Quilts. Kathy is honored to serve with Rev. Mark Koyama and Dr. Harriet Ward as coordinators of SAQM.</span></p><p><span>Join us for a thoughtful conversation with Mark, Harriet, and Kathy to learn more about how the project came into being, the important work it has done, and where the project is going. Registration for this event will also include time to view the quilts before and after the discussion.</span></p><p><span>The event is free to all, but tickets are extremely limited and <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-conversation-with-the-sacred-allies-tickets-631140447067" rel="nofollow">registration is required via Eventbrite</a>.</span></p><p><span>For more information, please email <a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org?subject=Sacred%20Allies%20Conversation">info@14beacon.org</a> or call 617.523.0470 ext. 223.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>This conversation is a component of the <em>Textile &amp; Text</em> exhibition that will be open to the public at the Congregational Library &amp; Archives June 19-21, 2023.

Together, these exhibitions demonstrate a shared thread of resistance and activism that can be traced through centuries of Congregational and American history.</p><p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/textile-text-sacred-ally-quilt-ministry-at-the-congregational-library-tickets-629239059967" rel="nofollow">Tickets are available for entry on the hour during the exhibition's opening hours on June 19th, 20th, and 21st.</a> Reserve your tickets today for these moving exhibitions at the Congregational Library &amp; Archives.</p><p> </p><h3>TEXTILE // Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry: Prayers in Thread</h3><p>During the long pandemic summer of 2020, nine United Church of Christ congregations in New Hampshire collaborated to make ten quilts that together memorialize the last words of George Floyd and document the painful experience of his death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in May 2020.</p><p><a href="https://www.saqm.org/" rel="nofollow">The Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry</a> uses the narrative art of quilting as both a healing balm and a catalyst for transformation. The creators hope that in viewing the quilts, people are led not only to remembrance, but to reflection and action. By creating space for sacred conversations within our communities, viewers begin to wash away the sin of white supremacy and racism—little by little, stitch by stitch.</p><p>These quilts are far more than a commentary on current events. They are a distillation of four hundred years of oppression. They express the devastating pain of America’s racial wounds. As Dr. Harriet Ward, member of Pilgrim United Church of Christ, Brentwood-Kingston and creator of three quilts for the Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry project so poignantly says, “‘I can’t breathe’ is the lamentation of centuries.”</p><p>In churches, schools, and colleges, the <em>Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry: Prayers in Thread</em> exhibition has become a powerful tool for provoking transformative conversations about race in the United States, contributing to Congregationalism’s long history of advancing social justice.</p><p> </p><h3>TEXT // Congregational Library &amp; Archives: Threads of Resistance</h3><p>For 170 years, the Congregational Library &amp; Archives has gathered and shared the story of Congregationalism and its impact in the United States and around the world. the<em> Threads of Resistance: Black Voices and Women’s Activism</em> exhibition was developed to accompany the Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry display and reveals the legacy of Black truth-speaking and the history of Congregational women’s activism over the centuries.</p><p>Letters, sermons, appeals, poetry, and other materials tell the stories of the first ordained African American Congregational minister, activists who founded anti-slavery and temperance societies, enslaved men and women who crafted confessions and relations of faith, and women who rejected the dominant theological frameworks of their time to become ministers, missionaries, and reformers.</p><p>From works by well-known figures like Langston Hughes, Antoinette Brown Blackwell, and Lemuel Haynes, to materials from individuals whose names deserve greater recognition, such as Lydia Bourne, Sarah Parker Remond, and Ella Hobart, this exhibition of materials drawn from the extensive collections of the Congregational Library &amp; Archives illustrates the diverse ways that women and men have challenged the status quo across the centuries of Congregational history.</p><p>Please get in touch with your questions via email at <a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org">info@14beacon.org</a> or by phone at 617-523-0470 ext 223.</p><p> </p><p>In connection with this exhibition, we are pleased to host a special conversation at the Congregational Library on Monday, June 19th from 2-4 pm EDT with the leaders of the Sacred Ally Quilt Ministry, Rev. Mark Koyama, Dr. Harriet Ward, and Kathy Blair. Tickets for this event are free, but extremely limited.

Talking about matricultural systems allows us to consider as primary the cultural context of a given society as perceived, constructed, and lived by its women. Similar to other cultural systems such as art, religion, or mathematics, employing the heuristic of matriculture allows for, among other things: cross-cultural comparisons; fresh insights into the social roles of women, men, otherwise identified, children, and the entire community of humans, animals, and the environment; and/or renewed understandings of historically mis-labelled cultures. With Guédon’s work in mind, then, and based on Geertzian principles, the concept of matriculture is both a model <i>of</i> reality by rendering the structure of matricultures apprehensible and a model <i>for</i> reality, where psychological relationships are organized under its guidance.</span></p><p><span>We encourage submissions from scholars around the world who are ready to take a new look at the ways in which people - historically and currently - have organized meaningful relationships amongst themselves and with the natural environment, the myths, customs, and laws which support these relationships, and the ways in which researchers have documented and perhaps mis-labeled the matricultures they have encountered.</span></p><p><span>For more information, visit our website: <a href="https://www.networkonculture.ca/activities/matrix" rel="nofollow">https://www.networkonculture.ca/activities/matrix</a></span></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Linnéa Rowlatt</p><p>Managing Editor</p><p><em>Matrix: A Journal for Matricultural Studies</em></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:lrowlatt@networkonculture.ca">lrowlatt@networkonculture.ca</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.networkonculture.ca/activities/matrix" target="_blank">https://www.networkonculture.ca/activities/matrix</a></div></div></div></description>

Phiroze Vasunia, Michael J. Franklin, Andrew Rudd, and others have commented at length on the ways in which English writers related to India during the Romantic period. Works by writers like William Jones, Phebe Gibbes, Robert Southey, Sydney Owenson, and Wilke Collins reveal the extent to which India became a point of creative fixation as well as cultural appropriation. The translations of many works of ancient and medieval Indic texts were important to the galvanization of the British literary imagination. We might ask if there is a way of amending some of the injurious perspectives that evolved over the course of the nineteenth century viz. India as the British Empire expanded its foothold, though not without appreciation for many areas of genuine exchange and learning between the philosophical traditions of Britain, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent that simultaneously occurred. English interest in India began during the Renaissance; however, during the Romantic period, the British Empire pivoted to India as its influence in the Atlantic weakened, following the American and Haitian Revolutions.</p>
<p>This panel explores how Anglophone writers translated and interpreted foundational religious texts in the Hindu tradition, such as the <em>Bhagavad Gita </em>and the <em>Upanishads</em>, as well as Sanskrit literary works such as Kalidasa's <em>Shakuntala. </em>We are particularly interested in papers that reflect on the underlying spiritual message and worldview of these texts and how it impacted literary creativity on both sides of the Atlantic. </p>

			<title>[ June 15, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Humans and Other Animals: Multifaith Responses to the Significance and Symbolism of Animals in Science and Religion Dialogue</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/111234</link>
						<description><ul><li>Deadline for abstract submission MIDNIGHT 15th June 2023</li>
<li>Deadline for RESIDENTIAL conference registration MIDNIGHT 6th August 2023</li>
<li>Deadline for NON-RESIDENTIAL conference registration 23rd August 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>The committee invites submission of papers that address the significance and symbolism of non-human animals within the science and religion dialogue. The committee welcome submissions from all faith perspectives and authors are invited to address the theme from a range of perspectives. For more details see https://www.srforum.org/srf-conference-2023-cambridge</p>
<p>The animal and religions dialogue has been growing over the last 25 years, the aim of this conference is to bring this broadening area of scholarship to dialogue with the science-religion arena through two broad strands:</p>
<p><em>Strand 1: </em>Perhaps viewed as the most prevalent interaction of science, religion and human-animal interactions, this strand focuses on ethical and environmental issues raised by anthropocentric views of the relationship. This strand focuses on animals in science and religion as the direct area of interest and thus includes but is not limited to matters of ecology, stewardship, and animal ethics (broadly construed and may relate to matters of urbanisation and conservation as well as animal-human relations).</p>
<p><em>Strand 2: </em>The second strand recognises the broader implications of scientific and interdisciplinary approaches to non-human animals on wider areas of theological enquiry. This strand examines the new perspectives that can be bought to the science-religion conversation through critical engagement with “the animal” adding further depth, theory, or methodology to our theological discussion. Areas of enquiry for this strand may include (but aren’t limited to) the matter of bestiaries, mythology, and fables, the relationship(s) between humans and animals, Incarnation and embodiment, Ritual / proto-religious behaviour in animals and textual and ritual meanings of animal bodies.</p>

<p>Essay Prize FAQs:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>I previously entered the Peacocke Prize can I enter again this year? We welcome new entries from previous applicants for the prize, however we do not accept resubmissions of previous entries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have already won the Peacocke Prize can I enter again? Peacocke Prize winners from the last three years are not eligible to enter again. The exception is if you won as a sixth form student and are now entering as an undergraduate or postgraduate student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can it be fair to have sixth form and university students competing for the same prize? We traditionally don’t receive many entries from sixth form students. However, if we receive a notable number, then as a committee we will look to judge the sixth form entries as a separate category with its own winner (including prize).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are undergraduate and postgraduate entries judged against each other? Yes. All university student work is judged together on its own merit. The Judging panel remove the entrant’s information (including UG/PG detail) prior to ranking responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I win do I have to attend the conference? No, it is part of the prize but you do not have to attend in person. You can choose to attend online or not at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I win do I have publish my essay? No, it is part of the prize but you do not have to publish your essay. However, we hope that you would like to share your work.</p>

Charles demanded that puritans change voting practices, baptismal policies, and laws, and he also cast an eye on local resources such as forests, a valuable source of masts for the English navy. In the face of this threat to local rule, colonists had to decide whether they would submit to the commissioners’ authority, which they viewed as arbitrary because it was not accountable to the people, or whether they would mobilize to defy the crown.</strong></p><p><strong>Those resisting the crown included not just freemen (voters) but also people often seen as excluded or marginalized such as non-freemen, indentured servants, and women. Together they crafted a potent regional constitutional culture in defiance of Charles II that was characterized by a skepticism of metropolitan ambition, a defense of civil and religious liberties, and a conviction that self-government was divinely sanctioned.</strong></p><p><strong>The event is free to all, but registration is required via this link: </strong><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FXyxEovIRASqkdZXmkR5Mg" rel="nofollow"><strong>https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FXyxEovIRASqkdZXmkR5Mg</strong></a></p><p><strong>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.</strong></p><p> </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><strong>For more information, please email <a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org?subject=A%20Constitutional%20Culture">info@14beacon.org</a>.</strong></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:info@14beacon.org">info@14beacon.org</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://www.congregationallibrary.org/events/constitutionalculture" target="_blank">https://www.congregationallibrary.org/events/constitutionalculture</a></div></div></div></description>

This talk will address parallel questions of hybridity and religious identity through the historical analysis of two religious spaces. The first is the Chunyang guan 純陽觀 in Xinjin 新津. First imagined and built in the late Qing dynasty as a space devoted to the three religions, in fact it functioned as a fully religious space only for a short time. In the early to mid-twentieth century it was variously used as an orphanage and school, and is now a museum and tea house, while still holding a liminal religious significance. The second example comes from a preliminary investigation of several different guildhalls (huiguan 會館) in Sichuan.  Originally multivalent spaces representing the business interests and religious beliefs of migrant communities entering Sichuan in the mid Qing dynasty, after losing their supporting communities and undergoing various historical vicissitudes, many are now in disrepair, shifting from religious to secular spaces, or being re-assigned to a different religious tradition, often Buddhist. The case of the Yuwang gong 禹王宮 in Lizhuang 李莊, now the Huiguang si 慧光寺 Buddhist monastery, is emblematic. Because of their shifting and fragile identities, their movement from sacralized to secularized or viceversa, the spaces under investigation are undercategorized, thus overlooked, understudied and marginalized. These examples might help in the historical investigation of other shifting religious sites in different parts of China.</p><p> </p><p>在調研四川及其周邊地區宗教傳統的過程中，文本與儀式中的宗教實踐呈現出多樣性與混雜性的特徵。本次講座通過對兩個宗教空間的史料分析，探討混雜性與宗教属性的平行问题。第一個案例是新津的純陽觀。此觀建於晚清，最初被想像為一個尊崇三教的空間，但事實上它只在短時間內完全發揮宗教空間的功能。自二十世紀起，它成為一個多功能的場所，二十世紀初期至中期曾被用作孤兒院兼學校，現在是一個博物館兼茶館，儘管仍具備有限的宗教意義。第二個例子來自對四川幾個不同會館的初步調研。清中期移民群體進入四川，建造了代表他們商業利益和宗教信仰的多功能空間，後來這些空間失去支持群體，又歷經歲月變遷，現在很多都年久失修，從宗教空間轉變為世俗空間，或者重新被賦予另一種宗教傳統，通常是佛教傳統。李莊的禹王宮，現在的佛教聖地慧光寺，就是典型的案例。由於它們多變而脆弱的属性，以及世俗化或神聖化的轉變，我調研的這些空間沒有被合理歸類，因而也被邊緣化，疏於重視和研究。這些例子有助於從歷史學的角度研究中國各地其他處於變化中的宗教場所。</p><p> </p><p><b><u>About the Speaker</u></b><b>:</b></p><p>Elena Valussi is a senior Lecturer in the History Department at Loyola University Chicago.

Robert E. Buswell Jr. conceptualises currents and countercurrents to describe the diverse regional strands of influence on the East Asian Buddhist tradition. Beside cross-regional developments, currents or subcurrents within a regional Buddhist tradition can manifest in the convergence and divergence between institutionalised teachings and local practices. Dominated mainly by lay people’s experiences of Buddhism, local practices and popular beliefs usually present a considerable degree of religious and cultural hybridity. Moreover, at a local level, religious rituals and liturgical performances are often integrated with vernacular genres of storytelling such as literature and drama. Since the inception of the eastward Buddhist missionary in the second or third century, some of these local currents prosper concomitantly with Buddhist monasteries that have been centres of regional learning and practice, while others are considered illegitimate and constantly banned by political authorities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This conference invites graduate students from the UK and Europe to submit proposals for presentations exploring local practices and popular beliefs in East Asian Buddhism.

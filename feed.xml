			<title>[ June 1, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: North American Society for Philosophical Hermeneutics</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/121546</link>
						<description><p>We invite submissions for the 19th annual meeting of the North American Society for Philosophical Hermeneutics. The 19th annual meeting will be hosted by Grand Valley State University and will take place September 12-14, 2024 on the campus of GVSU in Allendale, Michigan. Our keynote speaker this year is Dr. Leah McClimans (University of South Carolina). </p>
<p>Formed in 2005, NASPH is dedicated to furthering the study of philosophical hermeneutics and fostering dialogue in light of difference. While honoring the rootedness of philosophical hermeneutics in the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer, we find that the force and value of hermeneutics lie in the development of dialogue that brings life to history and illuminates contemporary issues.</p>
<p>Papers on all topics related to philosophical hermeneutics are welcome. Papers of 3000-5000 words, prepared for blind review, can be sent to nasphermeutics@gmail.com by June 1, 2024.</p></description>

We wish to explore multiple articulations and evidence of sameness through sound, image, text, performance, active recollection, and memory, in the context of increased otherisation. We are therefore interested in papers, which explore junctures, events, overlaps, and nodes, situated across time and space, which act as vestibules between the idea of “Muslimness” and “belonging”. Conceptions of Muslim belonging may not only be appended to notions of religiosity, but also explore linkages with class, caste, gender, hegemonies, place making, pioneership, and rootedness. The aim is to move beyond problematising the ills of authority and representation / mis-representation and invest in narratives which are first-person, self-reflexive, and agency specific. We look forward to hearing from early career scholars, advanced doctoral candidates as well as established academics from a range of disciplines, including but not limited to, ethnomusicology, film and media studies, history, literary studies, gender studies, sociology, anthropology, law and governance, economics, and performance studies. <strong>Abstract submission link: </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1k8Az6NuUvf7Zdhb3dtFzhjgkGUB15rRILZRW2sTVlMA/edit">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1k8Az6NuUvf7Zdhb3dtFzhjgkGUB15rRILZRW2sTVlMA/edit</a> <strong>Please send an abstract in about 150-200 words and a brief bio by 2 April, 2024 to <a href="mailto:soufieshahwar11@g.ucla.edu">soufieshahwar11@g.ucla.edu</a></strong></p>

In doing so, this forum builds on the foundation laid by a previous special forum titled <em>Redefining the American in Asian American Studies</em>, published in <em>JTAS</em> in 2012. That issue was part of a shift toward transnational perspectives in Asian American Studies that, in turn, influenced the development of the concept of “global Asias.” Meanwhile, scholars of comparative philosophy and comparative religion have begun to draw attention to how Asian American philosophical and religious practices in the United States are often obscured by the imprint of a binary racial politics upon religious discourse in the US. <em>Transnational Circuits of Asian Religio-Philosophy</em> brings together these two academic trends in order to consider how the reception of Asian religio-philosophy, broadly construed as religious and/or philosophical, in the US has shaped the meaning of both “Asian” and “American” as racial, cultural, political, and economic signifiers. </p>
<p>Tracing Asian thought over American cultural movements reveals apparent contradictions between the status of Asian religio-philosophy as countercultural and the racialization of Asian subjects as docile and assimilable. These contradictions demand critical investigation into a larger question of how Asian religio-philosophy and its reception can reveal points of imbrication between “global Asias” and transnational American studies. Relatedly, how and under what circumstances do Asian ideas and bodies travel to and in the Americas? How are ideas and bodies abstracted from one another and reified into American ideals of non/conformism, and what are the political stakes of restoring their relations?</p>
<p>We understand “Asian religio-philosophy” expansively as ontoepistemology, thereby allowing us to consider not only traditional schools of thought (e.g., Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism) but to include more recent Asian intellectual and political movements such as Maoism, Ghandian non-violence, or the work of Byung-Chul Han. We invite contributions that further scholarship on the transpacific and transimperial contexts in which Asian thought circulates. Submissions might consider a variety of critical topics, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asian religio-philosophy and American civil rights movements (e.g., Gandhi &amp;amp; Black American movements, Asian American anti-war efforts, Buddhist monk as protest figure)</li>
<li>Asian religio-philosophy in or contra American political theory (e.g., Benjamin Franklin and Confucianism, Confucius Institutes and foreign relations)</li>
<li>The links between Asian religio-philosophy, imperialism(s), and political economies (e.g., critiques of/participation in capitalism, state religion and nationalist paradigms)</li>
<li>Asian American and BIPOC literary and artistic engagements with Asian ontoepistemologies (e.g., Ruth Ozeki, Tuan Andrew Nguyen, Agha Shahid Ali, Wu-Tang Clan, Alice Coltrane)</li>
<li>The commodification and abstraction of Asian religio-philosophy in global circulation (e.g., martial arts/<em>qi</em>/<em>chakra</em>, <em>fengshui</em>, popular science and philosophy)</li>
<li>The deracination and/or racialization of sound in American music and spiritualism (e.g., yoga, gongs, Hindustani and Carnatic music, John Cage, The Beatles)</li>
<li>The transnational investments of American literary movements (e.g., Transcendentalists, Beats, Golden Age Science Fiction)</li>
<li>The reinscription of disciplinary boundaries and the role of Asian religio-philosophy in shaping the definitions of “religion,” “philosophy,” and “thought”</li>
</ul>

The roles of religion and religious thought in early Black culture have often been understood within the dualistic frame of resistance whereby Christianity, the dominant religion of colonial and antebellum American society, is both employed by masters to subjugate the enslaved and employed by the slaved to resist their masters’ subjugation of them. Scholars have thus considered the ways early Black writers strategically utilized Christian discourse to expose the hypocrisy of a supposedly Christian slaveholding society and appeal to a white audience for their civic inclusion within American democracy. Overall, the assumptive logic of such studies has been to understand religion and religious thought as a rhetorical and critical medium or tool for articulating issues of race, rights, and inclusion.  </p>
<p>While such critical approaches are no doubt important, this special issue examines how early Black writers turned to religious concepts to not only critique but think outside of the boundaries of civic belonging. The editors invite essays that broaden our understanding of early Black religious culture (i.e., Christian, Islam, West African, transnational, etc.) at the intersection of literary studies, rhetorical studies, religious studies, and print culture prior to the Civil War. <strong>We are interested in both formal article-length contributions (6,000-8,000 words) and shorter essays on “Consider the Source” that highlight innovative or creative ways of reading/using primary-source documents (3,000-5,000 words).</strong></p>
<p> <strong>To submit, please email a CV and a 1,000 word summary of the contribution you propose to write by June 30</strong> to Kevin Pyon (<a href="mailto:kbp5545@psu.edu">kbp5545@psu.edu</a>) and Don Holmes  (<a href="mailto:doh61@pitt.edu">doh61@pitt.edu</a>). Please use the subject line “Early African American Religion Special Issue Submission.” <strong>We will notify you of your preliminary acceptance by July 31, 2024 and final essays are due on December 31, 2024</strong>. Articles to be published are subject to peer review in 2025.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>How the Writer of Narnia Saw the End of Our Story</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>4th November 2024</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>At Union Theological College</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Belfast, Northern Ireland</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Co-Sponsored by </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>John Brown University</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p> In <em>The Sense of an Ending, </em>literary critic Frank Kermode famously speaks of ‘our deep need for intelligible Ends’, saying that ‘We project ourselves [...] past the End, so as to see the structure whole, a thing we cannot do from our spot of time in the middle’. This one day public-facing symposium aims to examine<strong> </strong>C.S. Lewis’s vision(s) of <em>last things</em>, exploring his depictions of the end in works such as <em>The Narnia Chronicles</em>, <em>The Cosmic Trilogy</em> (or any of his fictional works), and to explore his <em>sense of the end</em> in his non-fiction: for example, in his essays, letters, or theological writings. We invite scholars at every career stage to engage with this broad topic from a variety of different and creative approaches to suit their own interests; and we invite them to consider—in a more general way— how Lewis’s talent for capturing abstract concepts in concrete, relatable terms might make him an especially capable guide in helping readers to make sense not merely of the end, but of the entirety of our story. </p>
<p><strong>Call for Papers</strong></p>
<p>We invite proposals of up to 250 words for 20-minute papers on some aspect of our topic. Submissions are welcome from scholars at every career stage, from early career researchers to well-established. Please include a brief bio with your submission. </p>
<p><strong>Email Proposals to: </strong></p>

Those aspiring to be on the panel should feel empowered to offer proposals that interpret the concept of religion rather loosely by potentially including the humanities and health as faith driven institutions. Maintaining a broad interpretation of religion to include all intersections of faith, folklore, belief, and literature; expressions of belief may include creeds, mottos, mission statements, charters, manifestos, doctrines, etc. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are accepting all proposals that explore the intersection of religion and literature. Papers that engage with the convention’s theme of “Health in/of the Humanities” are particularly welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please submit abstracts with title of no more than 250 words and a 50-word bio to Dr. Seth Johnson at <a href="mailto:swjohnson3@ua.edu">swjohnson3@ua.edu</a>, no later than <strong>April 15, 2024</strong>.</p>

			<title>[ July 15, 2024] CFP for conference or similar: Experience and Non-Objects: Towards a Phenomenology of Indiscernibility</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/121286</link>
						<description><p>Exploratory workshop of the Society for the Phenomenology of Religious Experience</p>
<p>October 28-30, 2024, at the Simon Silverman Phenomenology Center, Duquesne University, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Confirmed Speakers: Michael Barber (St. Louis University), Michel Bitbol (CNRS, Paris), Peter Costello (Providence College), Neal DeRoo (Institute for Christian Studies, Canada), Crina Gschwandtner (Fordham University), Graham Harman (UCLA), Olga Louchakova-Schwartz (UC Davis), Martin Nitsche (Institute of Philosophy, Prague), Felix O’Murchadha (University of Galway)</p>
Experience and Non-Objects: Towards a Phenomenology of Indiscernibility
<p>For a long time, the objectlessness of religious experience has been a ground for denial of its existence. Yet, studies in phenomenology show these forms of experience exist, and are characterized by the intuition of the invisible. If such forms of experience are actual, the possibility of object-less perception and corresponding judgment can be extended toward experience in sciences. Specifically, this concerns the unobservable or indiscernible in quantum mechanics or quantum chemistry, or, to a lesser degree, the sciences of the brain.</p>
<p>In this invited workshop, we discuss relationships between the phenomenology of ordinary object-based everyday experience, and interesting, often religious, experiences which create a possibility for judgment (knowledge) of the invisible.  There are many accounts of the role of such experiences that can be drawn upon. For example,  under LSD, Carlo Rovelli had an experience that led him to formulate relational quantum mechanics. Another, dream experience of Mendeleev, provided an insight that led him to the development of the Periodical Table of Elements. Einstein is known to let his mind meander in the realm of imagination to crystallize his concepts. The recent Nobel Prize Winner, Anton Zielinger, stresses the role of imagination in quantum theorizing.  </p>
<p>True to Husserl’s view of metaphysics as the future task of phenomenology and drawing on both phenomenological and post-phenomenological perspectives and in dialogue with other contemporary philosophical approaches, the workshop will set out a perspective on how (to put it much too briefly) we can think the concept of reality containing both objects and non-objects, without reducing one to the other. Finally, we will also discuss how and if the concept of unified reality, which is theistic in its origin, participates in the object-less intuitions. </p>
<p>We still have space for submissions. The sphere of our interest rotates around the question of how and if the ego can “appresent” non-objects.  Disruptions of the everyday in meditation or the religious-spiritual practices of embodied inwardness (e.g., in Tantra,  Vedanta, the Prayer of the Heart, or other systems of religious experience) give us repetitive, predictable experiences, but what gives itself in these experiences?  And are these intuitions, presentations, or appresentations of the invisible? If there is a symmetry between the eidetics of embodied inwardness  and quantum concepts, what are conditions of possibility for this symmetry? Do the opposing arrows of time, multidimensionality of space, and other non-ordinary relationships, which manifest in these experiences, genuinely exist? Do such experiences encompass the notion of non-objects?  How can they be connected with eidetic intuition of quantum indiscernables (in a Leibnitzian sense)? What are the limits of mereology or logic in these analyses? “In the experience of embodied inwardness, how does the ego choose which aspect of passivity, the objects or non-objects, to bring into awareness? And ultimately: what is the sphere of validity for the theory of objects in confrontation with the invisible or indiscernible? We seek solutions from phenomenology of consciousness in its different forms: descriptive, eidetic, formal ontological, genetic, transcendental, or, lately, realistic, its mereology, topology, and apophansis, its provinces of meaning, in how they contribute to our conceptual picture of the world.</p>
<p>Around this broad spectrum of interconnected  themes, approximately ten talks will be accepted. Accepted talks and the rest of the submissions will be considered for publication in a topical issue of Frontiers. Selectively, we will provide support with applications for fee waivers. To be considered, please send a 300-word abstract to workshop2024@sophere.org. The mailbox is set for automated responses, so please check your spam folder if you do not receive a response. The deadline for submissions is June 15.  Acceptance notices will be sent out by August 15, 2024. We will accept original philosophical research reports,  hypotheses and theory, interpretive reviews, perspectives, case studies, reflections on method, and proposed research protocols.</p></description>

Experience and Non-Objects: Towards a Phenomenology of Indiscernibility
<p>For a long time, the objectlessness of religious experience has been a ground for denial of its existence. Yet, studies in phenomenology show these forms of experience exist, and are characterized by the intuition of the invisible. If such forms of experience are actual, the possibility of object-less perception and corresponding judgment can be extended toward experience in sciences. Specifically, this concerns the unobservable or indiscernible in quantum mechanics or quantum chemistry, or, to a lesser degree, the sciences of the brain.</p>
<p>In this invited workshop, we discuss relationships between the phenomenology of ordinary object-based everyday experience, and interesting, often religious, experiences which create a possibility for judgment (knowledge) of the invisible.  There are many accounts of the role of such experiences that can be drawn upon. For example,  under LSD, Carlo Rovelli had an experience that led him to formulate relational quantum mechanics. Another, dream experience of Mendeleev, provided an insight that led him to the development of the Periodical Table of Elements. Einstein is known to let his mind meander in the realm of imagination to crystallize his concepts. The recent Nobel Prize Winner, Anton Zielinger, stresses the role of imagination in quantum theorizing.  </p>
<p>True to Husserl’s view of metaphysics as the future task of phenomenology and drawing on both phenomenological and post-phenomenological perspectives and in dialogue with other contemporary philosophical approaches, the workshop will set out a perspective on how (to put it much too briefly) we can think the concept of reality containing both objects and non-objects, without reducing one to the other. Finally, we will also discuss how and if the concept of unified reality, which is theistic in its origin, participates in the object-less intuitions. </p>
<p>We still have space for submissions. The sphere of our interest rotates around the question of how and if the ego can “appresent” non-objects.  Disruptions of the everyday in meditation or the religious-spiritual practices of embodied inwardness (e.g., in Tantra,  Vedanta, the Prayer of the Heart, or other systems of religious experience) give us repetitive, predictable experiences, but what gives itself in these experiences?  And are these intuitions, presentations, or appresentations of the invisible? If there is a symmetry between the eidetics of embodied inwardness  and quantum concepts, what are conditions of possibility for this symmetry? Do the opposing arrows of time, multidimensionality of space, and other non-ordinary relationships, which manifest in these experiences, genuinely exist? Do such experiences encompass the notion of non-objects?  How can they be connected with eidetic intuition of quantum indiscernables (in a Leibnitzian sense)? What are the limits of mereology or logic in these analyses? “In the experience of embodied inwardness, how does the ego choose which aspect of passivity, the objects or non-objects, to bring into awareness? And ultimately: what is the sphere of validity for the theory of objects in confrontation with the invisible or indiscernible? We seek solutions from phenomenology of consciousness in its different forms: descriptive, eidetic, formal ontological, genetic, transcendental, or, lately, realistic, its mereology, topology, and apophansis, its provinces of meaning, in how they contribute to our conceptual picture of the world.</p>
<p>Around this broad spectrum of interconnected  themes, approximately ten talks will be accepted. Accepted talks and the rest of the submissions will be considered for publication in a topical issue of Frontiers. Selectively, we will provide support with applications for fee waivers. To be considered, please send a 300-word abstract to workshop2024@sophere.org. The mailbox is set for automated responses, so please check your spam folder if you do not receive a response. The deadline for submissions is June 15.  Acceptance notices will be sent out by August 15, 2024. We will accept original philosophical research reports,  hypotheses and theory, interpretive reviews, perspectives, case studies, reflections on method, and proposed research protocols.</p></description>

<p>Experience and Non-Objects: Towards a Phenomenology of Indiscernibility</p>
<p>For a long time, the objectlessness of religious experience has been a ground for denial of its existence. Yet, studies in phenomenology show these forms of experience exist, and are characterized by the intuition of the invisible. If such forms of experience are actual, the possibility of object-less perception and corresponding judgment can be extended toward experience in sciences. Specifically, this concerns the unobservable or indiscernible in quantum mechanics or quantum chemistry, or, to a lesser degree, the sciences of the brain.</p>

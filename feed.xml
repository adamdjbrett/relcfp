Thornton examines the locational metaphors orienting local creole cosmologies and considers in detail the spatial dimentions that inform their ritual logics. By diagramming the Spiritual Baptist universe and the sacred geography of Spirit that enlivens it, he shows how churchgoers reconciled diverse religious influences (from Africa, South Asia, Europe, and beyond) and probes for cosmolgraphical clues to their sybolically rich but often enigmatic rites and traditions.  </p><p>This event is offered both in-person on the University of Minnesota campus and as a simulcast Webinar.  Thursday, October 27, 2022, 3:30 pm (CDT). </p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Jeanne H.

To vote an example, the problem concerning the Self/Other pedagogical formulation in Western discoursrs is met with an equally equitable pull in the notions of the Self as the latent Other ( 'tattvam asi') in Vedantic thought.  I would like to therefore invite abstracts for an edited volume of essays which explore the theme of Politico- spiritual resistance in postcolonial spiritual literatures.  The thrust of the essays would include the insistence on reading spirituality as an episteme that embodies political, ethical, and/or social approaches that constantly threaten the attempt at epistemological Selving in Western discourses on Oriental education and pedagogy. Broadly, the themes could be under the following ( though not exhaustive) heads: 1. Spiritual thinkers in the Indian caneon and their responses to Western epistemology 2. Analysis of 'religious' texts as political manifestos in the minor/major canons of postcolonial/ anti-colonial literature 3. Dialogic interventions between Oriental spiritual discourses and Western counterparts in the long 19th c.  4. Religious episteme and it's correspondences with the 'Scientific' episteme vis-a-vis Colonial enterprise  We are already in contact with an international publisher. Hope to see the project completed by mid-2023. </p>

Led by articles emerging from the Brontë Society’s conference, <em>‘I wished to tell the truth’: Anne</em> <em>Brontë at 200</em> that was originally scheduled for 2020 but, due to the pandemic, was reorganised and held online in 2021, the Special Issue presents an ideal opportunity to challenge the long-held perception that the youngest Brontë sibling was the least talented and lacked the genius of her sisters. With Anne Brontë’s marginalisation in mind, potential topics for articles to be explored could include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationship between life and art/ Realism and didacticism</li>
<li>Feminist politics/ Feminist reassessment/Progressive social and political agenda</li>
<li>Attitudes toward childhood – education and development</li>
<li>Representation of the Victorian female artist</li>
<li>Biographical readings/Representation in bio-fictions</li>
<li>Legacy/Afterlives</li>
<li>New approaches to understanding and/or reading Anne Brontë</li>
</ul>

						<description>Publication Name: Edited Volume on the Phenomenology of Simone de Beauvoir<br/><br/><p>Considered in contrast to the work of her compatriots Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone de Beauvoir's work as a phenomenologist has received relatively little scholarly attention, despite its significant philosophical merit and interest. This edited volume aims to correct that oversight.</p>
<p>We invite potential contributors to submit original abstracts of approximately 500 words (for eventual chapters in the approx. 8000-10000 word range). There are a wide variety of potential topics, but all contributions should speak to the significance of Beauvoir's work as "core" existential phenomenology. Possibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparisons between Beauvoir and other major figures in Phenomenology as a philosophical movement</li>
<li>Beauvoir's work on traditional phenomenological problems or concepts (e.g., the problem of others / the Other, intersubjectivity, ambiguity, historicity, the body, etc.)</li>
<li>Unique emphases, concepts, or phenomena discussed in Beauvoir's work and their phenomenological significance (e.g. violence, oppression, gender, romantic love, childhood, etc.) </li>
<li>The significance of any of the above for contemporary phenomenologically-informed work</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapters should be scholarly but/and intelligible to non-specialists and advanced students. If interested, please submit abstracts by <strong>January 15, 2023 </strong>via email to <u>rharrison@vassar.edu</u> </p>
<p>Potential contributors will receive notification of acceptance by March 15. If your abstract is selected, full chapter drafts will be expected by January 2024. </p>
<p><strong>Questions? </strong>Contact Rebecca Harrison at rharrison@vassar.edu </p></description>

One center of such exchange was the so-called House with the Heads on Keizersgracht, the home of Louis de Geer and later his son Laurens. Both men acted as patrons to a variety of religious free thinkers and reformers. Figures such as Jan Comenius, Friedrich Breckling and Christian Hoburg gathered in the de Geer home to discuss their ideas. Today, the House with the Heads is home to the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica and its associated museum, the Embassy of the Free Mind. We are currently preparing an exhibition on the history of the House with the Heads. As part of these preparations, we are hosting a conference 11-12 November 2022 on the role of Amsterdam as a haven for religious refugees.</p><p>Over two days, a group of international experts will explore different groups’ or individuals’ experiences (Jews, Radical Pietists, Huguenots, etc.), the role of publishing in the city, patronage, conflicts between groups, urban versus rural strategies for survival, the role of war in the era and other related topics. The conference will take place on-site, but will also accommodate speakers from afar through digital connection. Likewise, the public can attend in person or remotely.

			<title>[ December 11, 2022] CFP for conference or similar: Husserl-Arbeitstage 2023. Reason and Relativity</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/104284</link>
						<description><p><strong>Husserl-Arbeitstage 2023,</strong> <strong>REASON AND RELATIVITY</strong></p>
<p>From Husserl’s early critique of psychologism in the <em>Prolegomena,</em> to his criticism of both naturalism and historicism in the <em>Logos</em> article, and his later diagnosis of the inner fragmentation of science and philosophy in the <em>Crisis</em>, phenomenology has confronted  diverse forms of relativism and skepticism. As one strategy for facing this challenge, Husserl elaborated a phenomenology of reason embracing the theoretical sphere of being and truth, the axiological sphere of value and genuine evaluation, and the practical sphere of authentic ethical action. He thereby placed the rational ideals of autonomy and self-responsibility at the heart of his project of philosophy as a rigorous science. Moreover, he advanced investigations of social and cultural realities by developing a phenomenological science of what is often considered ‘merely’ relative: Culture, history, and community. For the 2023 <em>Husserl-Arbeitstage</em>, the Husserl-Archives Leuven are inviting contributions concerning “Reason and Relativity”. Papers on a wide range of thematic issues are welcome, including, but not limited to, <em>experience and rational justification, moral and epistemic responsibility, normativity and rationality, cultural relativism and scientific universalism, essentialism and marginalization, scientific and philosophical thinking, foundations of social science</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Please send a two-page abstract or full paper before December 11th, 2022 to husserl2023@kuleuven.be. All submissions should be anonymized. Notifications of acceptance will be issued on December 20th, 2022. The conference will be held in English.</p></description>

He encapsulates the Western ideal in a spy hero from the Cold War Era till today. Though much has changed, this figure has been the focus of twenty-five (plus) films. He embodies popular culture for two generations of British and American viewers, and helps us to see the development of pop culture through film, social mores, and sexuality over time. He is a perfect topic for the <a href="https://rowman.com/Action/SERIES/_/LFATPC/Theology,-Religion,-and-Pop-Culture" rel="nofollow">Theology, Religion, and Pop Culture series</a>.</p><p>           </p><p>Having started in novels, and made more famous through film, Bond has spanned multiple generations of viewers, helping us to see the evolution of the character and the culture though the technology, sexual norms, and politics of several decades. He is a lens through which we can view religion and how religion has been portrayed over time. The accepted behavior of a character like Bond, as well as the accepted visuals of the series changed slowly, then rapidly over the course of the films. Having been played by six actors (not counting an outlier or two), he also has been interpreted and reinterpreted many times. As scholars, this gives us an opportunity to see how popular culture lenses have changed over time so that meaning, morals, and aesthetics can be central to this study. This is not meant to be a hit piece on Bond, as some scholars have done in recent years, but a critical study of a character that many of us enjoy, looking at the good while not ignoring the less than good. There’s a reason he is so beloved, despite his flaws; he taps into something underlying all of us – our very human nature.</p><p>           </p><p>The volume will focus on a number of themes, including, but not limited to: sin/redemption, sexuality, political theology, and religious plurality. Because of both its political and multicultural emphases, Bond gives us a glimpse at a British agent’s Cold War development as he engages multiple cultures and peoples. This is seen both in his own journey of redemption and his redemption of others. It is seen in his mistreatment of women and culture as well as his embrace of it. In Bond’s spycraft, we see both the good and the bad sides of human nature, sometimes at the same time. As can be inferred from the multitude of themes, this volume will engage both religious studies scholars and theologians, having some of both already signed on in the pre-seeding of this volume. Scholars of all types are welcome: religious studies, theology, philosophy, and other areas of the humanities.</p><p> </p><p>Though the volume will focus predominately on the films, I also hope to see proposals on Ian Fleming’s novels, the history and development of Bond, and perhaps even the video games and collectibles. We will have to see what the call for papers brings in, but there is a lot of fertile ground in the world of 007.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Some potential categories that are priorities for this volume are as follows (though other ideas are welcome!):</strong></p><p> </p><p>-World Religions in James Bond (and the accurate or inaccurate portrayal of them). This might be exploring the use of one religion, such as Hinduism or Buddhism throughout the Bond corpus, or examining a broader theme. (this topic is high priority)</p><p>-Redemption/Sacrifice/Salvation</p><p>-Sexual Ethics in Bond and Bond Girls</p><p>-Morality and Sin in the Context of Technology</p><p>-Ethics of Spycraft in the Cold War</p><p>-Good and Evil during the Cold War</p><p>-The Music of James Bond – Can either be a song or two, or the use of music throughout the series. (this topic is high priority)</p><p>-Political Theology in James Bond Films</p><p>-Religion in Ian Fleming’s James Bond Novels</p><p>-Religion/Theology in James Bond Comic Books (I know it will be tough to get this one, but if anyone is interested, I am listening!)</p><p>-M, Q, and Moneypenny – How do the supporting characters make for a robust theology in Bond?</p><p>-Bond by Actor: Looking for pieces that specifically will look at the individual film corpus of Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, and Craig (this topic is high priority – especially a piece on Lazenby/OHMSS)</p><p>-Bond by Film – Looking at the presentation of religion within individual films – implicit here is the cultural appropriation/interpretation of religion and culture in Bond films</p><p>-James Bond Collectables – the iconography of James Bond</p><p>-James Bond in Video Games (Goldeneye was groundbreaking in its development of first-person shooter games) – Exploring the philosophy of Bond on the small screen</p><p>Feel free to get creative. This volume looks to highlight creative, diverse, and well-researched chapters.</p><p>Abstracts should be approximately 300-500 words and should present a basic outline of your potential contribution to the volume and potential methodology. If you make the initial cut, you will be contacted by Dr. Tsakiridis to discuss and finalize your contribution to the volume. Send an abstract and a CV to <a href="mailto:religionandjamesbond@gmail.com">religionandjamesbond@gmail.com</a>.

			<title>[ August 31, 2023 -  September 2, 2023] Conference or similar: Love, Religion, and God</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/104198</link>
						<description>Venue: Lady Margaret Hall<br/><br/><p><strong>Keynote Speakers:</strong></p>
<p>Fiona Ellis (University of Roehampton)</p>
<p>Talbot Brewer (University of Virginia)</p>
<p>Judith Wolfe (University of St Andrews)</p>
<p>Paul Fiddes (University of Oxford)</p>
<p>The question of the relation between love, religion, and God is a central concern for both atheists and theists; and philosophers, theologians, and scientists have drawn interesting and sometimes conflicting conclusions about the nature of this relation and of the things related in this context. Can love be understood in the absence of God? Is love one thing or many things? And what is the relation between love and desire, or love and redemption? How are we to assess Nietzsche’s critique of Christian love? What is the role and value of love in non-theistic religious traditions? And in what sense, if any, should we accept that love is deeply mysterious?</p>
<p>These questions are attracting attention in recent scholarship, and the conference organisers are keen to examine the relevant issues from the vantage point of philosophy of religion as broadly conceived. We welcome papers taking a philosophical and/or theological approach to all aspects of love, religion, and God, including secular and diverse religious perspectives. We also encourage submissions from scholars who seek to make connections with other disciplines, such as religious studies, psychology, literature, and cognitive science. Members of under-represented groups are particularly encouraged to submit an abstract.</p>
<p>Those interested in presenting a short paper should send a proposal of no more than 250 words in a Word document to Dr David Worsley (<a target="_blank">david.worsley@york.ac.uk</a>) <strong>no earlier than 3rd January 2023 and no later than 31st March 2023.</strong> Please include the paper's title, and your name, institutional affiliation, and email address (these are not included in the 250 word word limit). We expect to notify people about whether their proposals have been accepted by 30th April 2023.</p>
<p>Some partial bursaries (including bursaries to cover the cost of childcare) may be available for participants who do not have another source of funding for attending the conference, with preference for these given to those who are presenting a paper. If you anticipate being in need of a bursary, please indicate this in your submission.</p></description>

The 19th and 20th centuries have witnessed the redefinition, in a changing geopolitical context, of the apostolic mission of these Christian organisations; in the field, they have increasingly called upon local clergy whom they themselves had trained, and who thus sometimes had to stand up against the racist discourses and practices of white administrators and clergy.</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><b>Conference 1 / Le Mans University / 23-24 March 2023 – Race and Contemporary Missiology</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>Through this first two-day conference on “Race and Contemporary Missiology”, the RelRace [ Religions, Lineages, Races] programme wishes to explore the contemporary uses of the concept of “race” in contemporary missiology, as well as all the vocabulary and themes of raciology that may have been developed in the 19th and 20th centuries in the writings of missionaries – both in their published (or unpublished) correspondence, and in their extra-apostolic work (linguistics, anthropology...).</span></span></p><p><span><span>The work of the ReLRace ANR programme argues that racial concepts based on religious foundations do exist and, from the eighteenth century onwards, have even coexisted with the notion of race as it was thought of within the framework of natural history and racial anthropology. Thus, as the new science of missiology developed in European and American Christian missionary circles in the second half of the 19th century, how did it integrate racialist theories into its principles with the various racial-religious traditions, particularly in an effort to scientifically legitimise the missionary enterprise [Dujardin and Prudhomme, 2015]? The Christian imperialism that characterised the Protestant movement of the late Victorian and early 20th centuries, for example, seemed paradoxically to combine the crudest forms and expressions of imperialist arrogance and racist prejudice with the internationalist and “humanist” vocation of the apostolic enterprise. However, how can the initial objective of creating autonomous indigenous churches – theorised by the Anglican Henry Venn as the “three selves principle” that is supposed to lead to the “euthanasia of the mission” –  be achieved when they are planted and developed in a colonial soil marked by violence and inequality between the “races”? Missionary organisations and the churches involved in the apostolic enterprise were subject to tensions on these issues, especially in colonial and post-colonial areas in the 19th and 20th centuries. The tropes associated with the notion of “race” were undoubtedly used by the actors of these debates, and this conference therefore calls on its future participants to shed light on this part of the history of missiology and missions, thanks to case studies from all continents, without necessarily focusing on European Christian missionary organisations alone.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The ReLRace ANR programmes has also wished to highlight the way in which African and Afro-descendant populations have adopted Christian and Muslim religions and challenged or even reversed the racial stigma with which they were associated. Early on, for example, African-American churches, notably the African Methodist Episcopalian Church (AME), launched missionary activity in the Caribbean, first, and then in Africa. Their preachers offered an approach that did not forego racial themes, but presented eminently different narratives that gave black populations pride of place.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Moreover, while a growing number of missionary organisations developed in Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the American continent throughout the 19th century, they also organised themselves in an increasingly systematic way and in a supranational, trans-imperial and interdenominational perspective: after the Edinburgh Conference in 1910, the creation of the World Council of Churches in 1938 reaffirmed mission-oriented churches’ desire to reflect on what missionary activities really meant. The delegates of major missionary organisations, as well as representatives of their agents on the field, were able to exchange views during these major events on topics such as the inclusion of courses in the sociology of religion or anthropology in the training of agents [Stanley, 2009], the use of vocabulary in the translation of sacred texts into vernacular languages, or the difficulties encountered by non-white Christians in colonial societies marked by the rise of anti-colonialism. Later, at the 1968 Uppsala Conference, for instance, the inter-generational as well as inter-racial tensions of a changing world could be felt, as when the YMCA delegates publicly expressed their belief that “imperialism and paternalism continue to be perpetuated in the structure and theology of the World Council of Churches”, even as the reiterated that “racism is a blatant denial of the Christian faith”.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The following lines of questioning could be explored:</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>1/ Missiology in the 19th and 20th centuries: how was “race” used in the science of missions?</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>This ReLRace programme wishes to examine the ways in which missiology, which was built up in part during events such as the International Council of Missions conference (from 1921 onwards), the Commission on World Mission and Evangelism (from 1961 onwards) and the World Council of Churches, as well as missionaries working in the field in various political, scientific and religious publications, were able to take up concepts linked to racialist theories in order to integrate them into their thinking or, on the contrary, to leave them aside or even to contradict them forcefully. Missionary periodicals, targeting a wide range of readerships –  both “enlightened” and not – can be a source of investigation, as well as the proceedings of conferences and meetings of missionary organisations at local and international levels.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>2/ Translation, linguistics, anthropology: how were racialised biblical narratives be integrated into scientific missionary work and writing?</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>Many missionaries were involved in the debates in American and European scientific societies and universities on monogenism and polygenism or racial anthropology, for example: how, then, did the themes and typologies used in these discussions and publications infuse missionary discourses and practices at a key moment when both the Protestant and Catholic missionary enterprises were beginning to reflect on their practices and objectives? Work on the translation of sacred texts, or on strategies for promoting the missionary enterprise, could be a particularly fertile field for this line of investigation.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>3/ Missions and race in colonial and post-colonial field: how did missionary organisations and their agents adapt to the mutations of colonial societies that were becoming independent nations in the second half of the 20th century?</b></span></span></p><p><span><span>How did missionary organisations receive the anti-colonial movements that flourished in Africa, Asia or the Pacific, sometimes within their own churches, and that were able to promote (sometimes armed) struggle against white colonisers? One example is the Indian theologian M.M. Thomas (1916-1996) of the Mar Thoma Church, who created the Programme to Combat Racism (1969), which financed armed liberation movements in South Africa and Rhodesia. Earlier, in the early 19th century, Uganda was the theatre of clashes between religious and social factions in which missionaries were involved because of their often controversial proximity to the British colonial administration in the territory.</span></span></p><p><span><span><i>Proposals along with a short CV should be sent to </i><a href="mailto:relrace@univ-lemans.fr"><i>relrace@univ-lemans.fr</i></a><i>, </i><a href="mailto:Maud.Michaud@univ-lemans.fr"><i>Maud.Michaud@univ-lemans.fr</i></a><i>, </i><a href="mailto:norig.neveu@univ-amu.fr"><i>norig.neveu@univ-amu.fr</i></a><i>, and </i><a href="mailto:annalauraturiano@gmail.com"><i>annalauraturiano@gmail.com</i></a><i> </i><i>by 15 January 2023 at the latest.

From the second half of the 19th century onwards, the training of a local clergy became an injunction within the framework of the Protestant and Catholic missionary redeployment, which resulted in tremendous changes on local cults. Numerous institutions were created to that end, such as schools, seminaries, congregations. Missions across the globe were called upon to encourage the indigenisation of their male and female staff by nurturing local vocations as much as possible. The rise of nationalist movements, as well as reflections within the pre-Conciliar Catholic Church, accelerated these dynamics.</span></span></p><p><span><span>How did religious institutions respond to the integration of indigenous clergy into their midst, and to complaints about racist behaviour? Is there a gendered dimension to be explored in this racialised understanding of clergy? What kind of policies followed from this phenomenon? How did local clerics, after their training and upon their return to the mission field, become agents of a sometimes racialist missiology, having to implement reforms with such perspectives? How did those institutions move from logics of nationalisation to practices of ethnicisation within the local churches at the end of the 20th century?</span></span></p><p><span><span>These indigenisation policies call for several initial observations that can sometimes appear paradoxical: the training of an indigenous clergy is apprehended and actually set up unequally according to the Churches and regions concerned. For example, in the Ottoman Empire, the seminary of Beit Jala was created in 1852 for Catholic priests of the Latin rite who were dependent on the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, whereas the Orthodox Church, in that region, resisted this Arabisation process, which resulted in protests from lay agents. In general, the indigenisation of missionary personnel occurred unevenly and was highly dependent on missionary hierarchy and surroundings. How churchgoers and political authorities reacted in the face of this indigenisation process should also be examined.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Local clerics became privileged auxiliaries of local governments, sometimes acting as intermediaries for the colonial powers. Apart from such in-between figures, how did religious men and women make demands within their institutions that could question the dynamics of subordination and domination?  This 2-day conference will be an opportunity to explore the interwining of missiology and field practices beyond the Christian churches, in particular in the context of the Muslim missionary deployment carried out by Ottoman authorities in the Middle East and/or the religious authorities in Africa and Asia, among others. </span></span></p><p><span><span>From the end of the Ottoman Empire, Muslim missionary action developed, especially in what was called the Arab provinces of the Empire. These missionaries embodied a reform discourse that played on the supposed backwardness of the targeted populations and the need to standardize their religious practices. How did the question of race fit in these discourses? How did physiology play a part in missionary action in the field? In the same way, the <i>da'wa</i> advocated and practised by the various representatives of Salafism or by different reformist movements such as the <i>Tablighi Jama'at</i> (a society for the “propagation of the faith” founded in India in 1927) is commonly referred to as a missionary enterprise in academic literature. Can this theoretical reflection on <i>da'wa</i>, somehow a Muslim “missiology” itself, be understood in terms of racial issues? How did preaching, apostolic work and racial issues intertwine in the discourses and practices of movements such as the Nation of Islam?  Were specific modes of missionary action employed depending on the targeted audiences? How were these ideas theorised or practised in the field? How can we put these dynamics into perspective with those that run through Christian missiology?</span></span></p><p><span><span>In order to explore these dynamics, participants could take the following three axes into account:</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>1/</b> <b>The training of indigenous clergy in the mission field.</b> How were calls to train indigenous clergy implemented? Which institutions were in charge of such training and how did they imprint, convey and pass on racial ideas? Our focus will be on the processes of training local clergy, through analyzing the training institutions, their functioning and the profiles of the training personnel. Among other things, the opening of “indigenous novitiates” by Christian missions in the Middle East, Africa and Asia will be examined. In addition to practices, this conference could reflect on the discourses and racial perspectives underlying the functioning of formation institutions. For example, how was the concept of race conjured up to justify the formation of “indigenous” religious men and women as intermediaries between foreign missionaries, the churches and local societies?  </span></span></p><p><span><span><b>2/ Interactions, resistance and tensions between missionaries and European clergy / between indigenous clergy and European clergy.</b> What place did the indigenous clergy have in the religious and missionary hierarchy? Could the relationship between them be thought of in terms of domination/subordination? How did gender, race and other differentiating factors intertwine to produce a “grammar of difference” within church and missionary spaces? How did racial perspectives lead to the domestication of bodies and the imposition of new gender norms? This section will look at the interactions and power relations within church and missionary space. It will focus on the question of subalternity and on reactions to racist practices.</span></span></p><p><span><span><b>3/ Indigenous clergy, missionary society and racial dynamics.</b> How did the indigenous clergy internalise the racialist perspectives that could be integral to their training? How did they (re)contextualise these perspectives in preaching and social action in mission societies? How were such perspectives translated into missionary action? What were the specific claims of the indigenous clergy? How did scientific societies, associations or media contribute to the organisation of this local clergy? What racial elaborations were forged and developed out of them? This axis will analyse how the injunctions of reform and modernity made local clerics the agents of racialist policies. It will reflect on the ways in which, in some contexts, once in office and set up in a position of subordination, clerics could stand up against the policies of their religious institutions. Finally, it will reflect on how the implementation of local clergy, their interaction with missionary societies or the laity differed from one denomination to another, according to context and chronology.</span></span></p><p><i><span><span>Proposals along with a short CV should be sent to </span></span></i><span><span><a href="mailto:relrace@univ-lemans.fr"><i>relrace@univ-lemans.fr</i></a></span></span><i><span><span>, </span></span></i><span><span><a href="mailto:Maud.Michaud@univ-lemans.fr"><i>Maud.Michaud@univ-lemans.fr</i></a></span></span><i><span><span>, </span></span></i><span><span><a href="mailto:norig.neveu@univ-amu.fr"><i>norig.neveu@univ-amu.fr</i></a></span></span><i><span><span>, and </span></span></i><span><span><a href="mailto:annalauraturiano@gmail.com"><i>annalauraturiano@gmail.com</i></a></span></span><i> <span><span>by 15 January 2023 at the latest.

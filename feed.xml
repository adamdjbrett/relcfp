In his extant fragments, Democritus claims that the poet writes by divine inspiration (fr. 17) and that Homer's greatness is due to his godlike nature (fr. 21). But the great systematiser of this doctrine is undoubtedly Plato, in dialogues such as the <em>Phaedrus</em>, <em>The Laws</em> and, above all, the <em>Ion</em>: the poet's art cannot be explained by craftsmanship, but by a divine rapture of which the poet remains ignorant. This notion had a long history in Antiquity, and is reformulated in the works of Cicero, Horatius, Seneca or Statius, among others. In the Middle Ages, <em>furor poeticus</em> was easily assimilated into Christian categories, leading to the ideology of the poet as a "scriba Dei" in authors such as Alain de Lille or Dante Alighieri.</p>
<p>With the revival of Neoplatonism in Western Europe, the humanists of the fifteenth century took up the teachings of Plato and adapted them to the needs of their own time. Coluccio Salutati, Leonardo Bruni and other representatives of Florentine civic humanism provided the first modern reception of the idea, using Cicero and Isidore of Seville as primary sources. It was Marsilio Ficino, translator and commentator on the <em>Ion</em>, who gave the concept its modern form. In his 1457 epistle <em>De Divino Furore</em> and in his treatise on <em>Theologia Platonica</em> (1482), Ficino identifies four types of divine inspiration ("furor divinus"), one of which is "furor poeticus": the divine power that possesses true literary creators. Ficino's followers, such as Poliziano or Landino, adopted the Platonic concept, but also raised the old problem of whether inspiration (<em>ingenium</em>) alone was sufficient, or whether it had to be combined with a mastery of poetic craftsmanship (<em>ars</em>).</p>
<p>The edited volume (under negotiation with a top international publisher) seeks to explore the afterlife of this poetological idea in modern literature and poetics in the broadest sense from sixteenth century to the present.</p>
<p>The edited volume invites essays on the following themes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>-<em>Furor poeticus</em> in the Renaissance and beyond: Ludovico Ariosto, Giordano Bruno, Marco Girolamo Vida, George Chapman, George Puttenham, John of the Cross and the mystics, the poets of La Pléiade… What are the links of these authors with Neoplatonism, Orphism, Christianity and other religions or spiritual movements?</p>
<p>-In eighteenth-century aesthetics, the concept of genius seems to take the place traditionally occupied by <em>furor poeticus</em>: Lord Shaftesbury, Edmund Burke, Edward Young, William Duff, Immanuel Kant...</p>
<p>-The Romantic appropriation of the idea of <em>furor poeticus</em> in authors such as Hölderlin, Hamann, Coleridge, Blake, De Quincey. Divine rapture turns into personal madness.</p>
<p>-Secularisations of <em>furor poeticus</em> from the nineteenth century onwards: Schopenhauer interprets it as a mental illness and Freud as adult daydreams that replace child's play.</p>
<p>-Presences of <em>furor poeticus</em> in contemporary literary theory: Harold Bloom's concept of "influence" or Angus Fletcher's concept of "allegory".</p>
<p>-Reception and transformation of the idea in contemporary writers: Antonin Artaud, Ted Hughes, Anne Sexton, Leopoldo María Panero… Comparative approaches are also welcome.</p>
<p>Please submit your proposal title and a 600-800 words abstract together with a short CV including current affiliation, academic position, ORCID and main publications. All essays, written in English, must be original and unpublished.</p>
<p>Abstracts should be emailed by 15 March 2024 to <a href="mailto:furorpoeticuscall@gmail.com">furorpoeticuscall@gmail.com</a></p>

						<description>Publication Name: The Sedes Sapientiae: Roots, Prospects, and Fruits of Philosophizing in Mary<br/><br/><p>Occasioned by the 25th anniversary of <em>Fides et Ratio</em>, this volume seeks to collect a series of original contributions on the <em>Sedes Sapientiae</em> as a model for true philosophy, as suggested by the encyclical’s final paragraph. The goal is to traverse the profound dialogue between philosophical inquiry and Marian themes, fostering a multidisciplinary discourse at the intersection of Philosophy and Mariology.</p>
<p>The book is structured into three thematic parts, each inviting a deep dive into the nuanced relationship between philosophical thought and Marian reflections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Roots</strong>: The first part looks at traditions to draw from or build on where the link between Mary and/as philosophy is implicitly present. Examples for contributions in this section would be philosophy as a female figure in (Greek) philosophy, or Wisdom as a female figure in the Old Testament. Any Marian or mariological themes or traditions that indicate the fruitfulness for a link with philosophy would also be welcome here. The criterion is that the link between Mary and philosophy must be implicit, but can be taken as a source of inspiration to think through, or even as a kind of prefigurement of, this relation, </li>
<li><strong>Prospects</strong>: This second part deals with explicit considerations on the possible benefits and challenges of this project. It would consist of meta-philosophical considerations, methodological questions, as well as input from (philosophical) mariology on such a link. The debate on christian philosophy and whether Mary could contribute something to that debate, would also be very welcome. The criterion is that the link between Mary-philosophy is made explicit, but on a meta-level or as a preparatory step. </li>
<li><strong>Fruits</strong>: The third part looks for concrete applications of what philosophising in Mary would actually look like – the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Are there specific issues in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics or aesthetics that could benefit from philosophising in Mary? Evidently, themes in the philosophy of religion, like arguments for the existence of God, would also be very welcome. Or, what would the history of philosophy look like through a Marian lens? The criterion for this section is that a specific philosophical problem or theme is approached by actually philosophising in Mary.</li>
</ol>
<p>We welcome submissions that approach this overall theme and these three categories from a diverse range of philosophical perspectives, fostering a rich and multifaceted exploration. Chapters may engage with historical, contemporary, or innovative discussions, and we are open to a variety of methodological approaches. We also aim for a mix of both established scholars and young researchers.</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract Submission Deadline: March 25th, 2024</li>
<li>Notification of acceptance: May 1st, 2024</li>
<li>Full Chapter Submission Deadline: September 8th, 2024</li>
<li>Abstract Length: 500-1000 words</li>
<li>Chapter Length: 6,000-8,000 words</li>
<li>Submission Email: contact@sedessapientiae.be</li>
</ul>
<p>Please include with your abstract a brief biographical note with your institutional affiliation and contact information. Notification of acceptance will be communicated by May 1st.</p>
<p>This volume aspires to be a fruitful ground for illuminating discussions, widening the horizon of philosophical and theological engagements with Mariology. We look forward to receiving your contributions to this scholarly dialogue.</p>
<p>Warmest regards,</p>
<p>Dr. Michaël Bauwens and Dr. Joseph Terry</p></description>

			<title>[ September 15, 2024 -  September 22, 2024] Conference or similar: Death, Movement, Change and Transformation: The Domain of Matter with Thomas Nail, John Ó Maoilearca, Achille Mbembe (TBC) and Jonathan Fardy,</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/118661</link>
						<description>Venue: https://www.google.com/maps/place/SMR-ISSHS+Greece/@40.5913033,23.7799166,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x14a8df0018095c6b:0x1bbe709976b39472!8m2!3d40.5913033!4d23.7824915!16s%2Fg%2F11vplxjttq?entry=ttu<br/><br/><p>Why has something as simple as movement posed such enormous difficulties for philosophers and scientists in the Western tradition when other traditions have not had the same trouble? Many of the greatest minds of Western history have dedicated their lives to the discovery of something genuinely immobile that could explain why things move," is the question from which the three master classes offered by Thomas Nail depart. Nail's series of classes is called Matter and Motion: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Movement. In the elaboration of his set of master classes offered as part of the summer school, titled "As Above, So Below: Correspondences, the Supernothing, and the Hyperbolic," John John Ó Maoilearca says "Here, the ‘non-‘ will be seen to operate in full plenitude, though at another level/scope/temporality (rather than ex nihilo – from the inert void below), The ideas of destruction and negation are consequently re-rendered as substitution, confusion, or destructive interference between levels." Achille Mbembe, who has initially confirmed his participation (we are expecting a reconfirmation of dates and topics) is invited to revisit his materialist radicalisation of the concept of necropolitics he explored as part of the SMR Intensive Study Courses in Fall 2021.</p></description>

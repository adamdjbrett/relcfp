This volume offers not only an annotated list of its invaluable resources, but also reproduces the full text of a few rare or unique Chinese Christian texts. The Catalogue, compiled by Dr. Ad Dudink (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, ret.) and edited by Drs. Giuseppe Zhao Hongtao (Centre for Chinese Studies, Pontifical Urbanian University, Rome) and Emanuele Raini (University "L'Orientale", Naples) is preceded by an essay by Dr. Eugenio Menegon (Boston University) that gives a full explanation of the entire structure and contents of the Archives pertaining to the China missions and sketches the activity of Propaganda Fide missionaries in China up to the early 19th century. The Chinese documents catalogued here open a window on the daily life of the Chinese Christian communities and their pastors, and the reaction of Chinese society to Catholic activities. Read together with the letters and reports sent from Asia in European languages to accompany them, they offer a corrective to a Rome-centered vision of the missions.</p><p>You are welcome to participate through this link: <span> </span><a href="https://bostonu.zoom.us/j/7085784737" rel="nofollow">https://bostonu.zoom.us/j/7085784737</a></p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p>Daryl Ireland</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:dri@bu.edu">dri@bu.edu</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://bostonu.zoom.us/j/7085784737" target="_blank">https://bostonu.zoom.us/j/7085784737</a></div></div></div></description>

The purpose of the Prize is to recognize and stimulate new work in vernacular Catholicism and to commemorate the life and work of distinguished scholar Leonard Norman Primiano (1957-2021).</p><p>Primiano was a folklorist, religious studies scholar, and educator who published widely on the religious traditions of American Catholics and others from the methodological perspective of what he termed “vernacular religion.” He defined vernacular religion as, “religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it.” The definition was a departure from the terms “lay,” “folk,” or “unofficial” religion which were often contrasted with “institutional” or “official” religion. Primiano sought to unify these disparate discourses into one framework that invited scholars to engage deeply in the lives of their fieldwork collaborators. He challenged scholars to take seriously the minutiae of how people live their religion in particular contexts, their interaction with material culture, their often-flexible attitude to and use of tradition, their frequently complex relationships and negotiations with institutional forms of religiosity, and above all their agency. In the spirit of this method, the work should be interdisciplinary with attention to the religious life of the individual as well verbal, customary, and/or material expressions of religious believers.</p><h3>Submission guidelines</h3><ul><li>All submissions must be focused on vernacular Catholicism, broadly construed.</li><li>Works submitted must be book-length monographs in English published in the 16 months prior to the annual submission deadline of <strong>May 1.</strong> </li><li>Articles, dissertations, reissues of older works (unless they have been substantially revised and rewritten), editions of works by others, or works-in-progress will not be considered for the prize.</li><li>A cash award is made to the winner or winners of the prize. </li><li>If no entry is deemed worthy, no prize will be awarded. </li><li>AFS requires that publishers submit hard copies of all books, with the exception of books that are only available in electronic formats.</li><li>The winner/s will be announced at the American Folklore Society’s annual meeting in October or November each year. </li><li>Publishers should mail four copies (clothbound or paperback) to American Folklore Society, “attention: Leonard Norman Primiano Book Prize,” 800 East Third Street, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.

<p>The 90s opened a time of optimism for proponents of constitutional democracy who were vividly discussing the possibilities of public deliberation and rational dialogue. However, these last few years have seen the re-emergence of radical and antagonistic forms of politics - populism, nativism, and left activism. We currently find ourselves in "an <em>interregnum</em>: a period of crisis during which several tenets of the [political] consensus (...) are challenged" and where "a solution to the crisis is not yet in sight" (Mouffe, 2018).  </p>
<p>This "crisis of liberalism" sets the tone of the discussions on the left and on the right. On the left, debates have centered around radical democracy, left populism, and on the means to further radicalize democracy (Mouffe 2018, de la Torre and Srisa-nga 2021). Radical democrats claim that they seek to reform liberalism rather than reject it, yet they are often more explicit about what they reject in liberalism than about what they wish to retain. On the right, many have been more candid, calling themselves "postliberals" (Deneen 2018) and embracing populist (Benoist 2017) or nationalist (Hazony 2022) alternatives.  </p>
<p>Liberal and moderate responses to these developments have been markedly defensive. On the one hand, several works have taken a critical approach to populism (Müller 2016, Urbinati 2019) and identity politics (Fukuyama 2018). On the other hand, there have been talks of how a militant democracy (Malkopoulou and Kirshner 2019) could be deployed to contain the extremes. But here, too, the discussion is more about the defensive response that liberals should adopt against the extremes.  </p>
<p>The questions that seem to be missing are the sort of new narratives and new self-understanding that moderates should develop in response to the extremes. In the 1930s, several liberal landmarks emerged, not just as critiques, but as insightful and original reaffirmations of the open society (Lippmann 1937, Popper 1944). What, then, is extremism and what unites it? What is moderation (Craiutu 2023)? What conceptions of democracy and politics should moderates develop in response to the extremes (Muller 2021)? The panel welcomes contributions related (but not limited) to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is extremism? What is moderation? How should we understand and frame this binary historically and philosophically?</li>
<li>What new conceptions of democracy and politics should moderates develop in response to the extremes?</li>
<li>What are the potential benefits and shortcomings of extremism/moderation? For instance, can extremism act as a "corrective"? Does moderation have depoliticizing tendencies?</li>
<li>What are some of the rhetorical tactics of extremism (e.g., demonization) and how can moderates counter them? Should moderates adopt militant democracy?</li>
</ul>

			<title>[ September 7, 2023] CFP for conference or similar: Post-Pandemic Condition: Biopolitics in the Aftermath of the COVID-19</title>
			<link>https://philevents.org/event/show/109293</link>
						<description><p><strong>C</strong><strong>all for </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>apers</strong><strong>: International Conference </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-Pandemic Condition: </strong><strong>Biopolitics in the </strong><strong>Aftermath of the </strong><strong>COVID-19</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Conference Date: 7 September, 2023</p>
<p>National Gallery of Art, Konstitucijos pr. 22, Vilnius</p>
<p>The conference ‘Post-Pandemic Condition: Biopolitics in the Aftermath of the COVID-19’ revisits the concept of biopolitics by asking how the pandemic has redefined the political field and what new concepts and prospects it can offer for conceptualising our post-pandemic condition. </p>
<p>The worldwide health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly signalled the need to reconsider, modify, and even transform the notion of biopolitics. Numerous attempts to do so were ranging from nearly apocalyptic visions of entirely ‘negative’ biopolitics, such as Giorgio Agamben’s collection of brief essays <em>Where Are We Now?</em> (2021), to surveillance-friendly ‘positive’ biopolitics, exemplified by Benjamin Bratton’s <em>The Revenge of the Real</em> (2021). Most of these, however, were published at the very peak of the pandemic, and therefore mostly based on different approaches of national governments towards the management of the pandemic and their implementation, and not the consequences of the pandemic biopolitics itself. </p>
<p>Roughly three years after the breakout of the pandemic, it is time to revisit the notion of biopolitics itself and to question its viability in the aftermath of COVID-19. Many theoreticians emphasize that the pandemic cannot be separated from the existing social and political conditions which include nationalism, racism, global inequality, poverty, violence against women and LGBTQ+ people, and environmental destruction. In enduring pandemic times these conditions were radicalised and made even more unbearable. At the same time theoreticians express a need to overcome these radical inequalities and reimagine a ‘shared or common world’ (Judith Butler), ‘the world in common’ (Achille Mbembe) that would ensure a universal right to live.</p>
<p>The universal right to live belongs to the universal community of earthly inhabitants, human and nonhuman. This implies that the conventional model of individual rights and freedoms should be revisited in favour of communal forms of existence. As Judith Butler points out, the term ‘pandemic’ derives etymologically from <em>pan-demos</em>, all the people, or people everywhere, or something that crosses over or spread over and through the people (<em>What World Is This?,</em> p. 5). Thus the post-pandemic condition implies that thinking about the insular and autonomous individual should be abandoned since every individual discovers itself in the position of interconnectedness and encroachment. The post-pandemic condition forces us to rethink ourselves in terms of common immunity (Roberto Esposito), the transindividual (Etienne Balibar), or holobiont (Bruno Latour), and to acknowledge our debt to global ecology.     </p>
<p>Key areas of inquiry could include but are by no means limited to: </p>
<p>• pandemic and paradigmatic shifts within and beyond the notion of biopolitics; </p>
<p>• political, economic, racial, and social implications of pandemic biopolitics; </p>
<p>• new philosophical, political and social imaginaries; </p>
<p>• the individual “self” and other forms of communal existence; </p>
<p>• immunity and immunization VS community-oriented approaches after the pandemic; </p>
<p>• individual rights and freedoms VS universal right to live; </p>
<p>• post-pandemic governmentality VS environmentality;</p>
<p>• ecological crisis, biopolitics, and the Anthropocene;</p>
<p>• affective and artistic expressions of the post-pandemic condition.</p>
<p>Conference format: in person </p>
<p><strong>Submission guidelines: </strong></p>
<p>Deadline for abstract submission: 1 June 2023</p>
<p>Notification of acceptance: 10 June 2023</p>
<p>Conference dates: 7 September 2023</p>

Many people (especially in South China) refrained from consuming the meat of buffaloes and oxen (both species being referred to by same term: niu). The dietary prohibition was related to the divinity of the animal. Legend had it that that the ox (and/or buffalo) was a Buddhist deity who descended from Heaven for the express purpose of pulling the plow. The animal was a god who sacrificed itself for its owner’s sake. Eating if flesh was not only thankless, it was blasphemous.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In this paper, I trace the origins of the late-imperial Chinese beef taboo to ancient India. I argue that Buddhism served as a vehicle introducing the Indian inviolability of the cattle to China. The sanctity of the Chinese ox/buffalo derived from the divinity of the Indian cow. The paper highlights the role of Buddhism in bringing Indian civilization to bear upon Chinese culture and religion. It also reveals a neglected aspect of Buddhist dietary practice. At least in certain times and places, Buddhist clerics advocated the inviolability of the cattle as distinct from other animal species. They refrained from consuming beef as distinct from other meats.  </span></span></p><p> </p><p><u><span><span>About the Speaker</span></span></u></p><p><span><span>Meir Shahar is the Shoul N. Eisenberg Chair for East Asian Affairs at Tel Aviv University. He is the author of numerous books on Chinese religion, including <i>Crazy Ji: Chinese Religion and Popular Literature</i> (1998); <i>Oedipal God: The Chinese Nezha and his Indian Origins</i> (2015); and <i>The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts</i> (2008), which has been translated into many languages. Meir Shahar is currently completing a book titled <i>Kings of Oxen and Horses: Draft Animals, Buddhism, and Chinese Rural Religion</i>. </span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span><u>About the Yin-Cheng Distinguished Lecture Series</u></span></span></p><p><span><span>Launched in September 2021, the Yin-Cheng Distinguished Lecture Series (<span>印證佛學傑出學術系列講座</span>) is a collaborative, multi-university partnership between Peking University, Columbia University, Princeton University, Harvard University, University of British Columbia, University of Oxford and University of Cambridge.

White of Aberystwyth University</strong> and <strong>Heather Sharkey of the University of Pennsylvania.</strong> White will address <strong>"The Bible in Welsh: Unintended Salvation?"</strong> while Sharkey will explore <strong>"British Arabic Bibles: Global Histories, Local Books."</strong> <strong>Martha G.

Can a single book have so much impact? In this paper, I will argue that the positive impact on the language may have been unintended by the authorities and owed more to a group of committed Welsh humanists who took advantage of the political context of the time."</p><p>Sharkey adds: "Between 1908 and 1965, the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) published Bible translations in nine forms of North African Arabic.  In the wake of decolonization, Arab critics accused the BFBS and British powers of having used these Bibles as a tool of imperialism – to break up and weaken Arabs by propagating linguistic distinctions among them.  These British Arabic Bibles, I argue instead, reflected not a conscious tactic of divide and rule, but rather evangelical impulses and historical experiences from the British Isles and North America."</p><p>For more detail, please visit the BIES website, <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/bies/" rel="nofollow">https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/bies/</a>.</p><p>Questions?

We are especially interested in contributions on radical communal groups and utopian efforts from the early modern period onward.  Potential topics could include Oneida Community, the Icarians, the Amana Colonies, Diggers, Fruitlands, Fountain Grove, a utopian community of the 1960s or 1970s, Rajneeshpuram, temporary autonomous zones, religiously inspired utopian (or ultimately dystopian) communities, or similar topics. Historically focused explorations are welcome, and we are also interested in explorations from other approaches and methodologies. Other topics concerning radical groups or individuals across the political spectrum are also welcome.</p><p>Completed articles due by November 15, 2023; contact editors at <a href="mailto:jsrmsu@gmail.com">jsrmsu@gmail.com</a> for queries. </p><p><i>Background</i></p><p>The <i>Journal for the Study of Radicalism</i> engages in serious, scholarly exploration of the forms, representations, meanings, and historical influences of radical social movements. With sensitivity and openness to historical and cultural contexts of the term, we loosely define "radical," as distinguished from "reformers," to mean groups who seek revolutionary alternatives to hegemonic social and political institutions, and who use violent or non-violent means to resist authority and to bring about change. The journal is eclectic, without dogma or strict political agenda, and ranges broadly across social and political groups worldwide, whether typically defined as "left" or "right." We expect contributors to come from a wide range of fields and disciplines. We especially welcome articles that reconceptualize definitions and theories of radicalism, feature underrepresented radical groups, and introduce new topics and methods of study.</p><p>Submissions should be 20-30 pages in length, in .doc format, and conform to Chicago Manual of Style endnotes. Please include a one-paragraph abstract. Images for possible use in an article should be 300 dpi. Authors are responsible for requesting and receiving permission to reprint images for scholarly use.</p><p>See <a href="https://msupress.org/journals/journal-for-the-study-of-radicalism/%C2%A0for" rel="nofollow">https://msupress.org/journals/journal-for-the-study-of-radicalism/ for</a> more information.</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Info: </div><div><div><p><em>Background</em></p><p><em>JSR</em>’s primary purpose is to serve as a venue for fine scholarship in this developing academic field. We expect scholarly contributors to come from a wide range of perspectives and disciplines, and we especially welcome articles that reconceptualize definitions and theories of radicalism, feature underrepresented radical groups, and introduce new topics and methods of study. We seek articles that make a clear larger point, and that offer a real contribution to the field.</p><p><i>Journal Editor</i><br/>Arthur Versluis, Michigan State University</p><p><i>Journal Associate Editor</i><br/>Morgan Shipley, Michigan State University</p><p><i>Editorial Board</i><br/>Constance Bantman, University of Surrey<br/>Michael Barkun, Syracuse University<br/>Colin Beck, Pomona College<br/>Steven Biel, Harvard University<br/>Pero Dagbovie, Michigan State University<br/>Daniel Farber, University of Kansas<br/>Tor Egil Førland, University of Oslo<br/>Scott Henkel, University of Wyoming<br/>Ariel Hessayon, Goldsmiths College, University of London<br/>Richard Bach Jensen, Louisiana Scholars’ College, Northwestern State University<br/>Alex Khasnabish, Mount Saint Vincent University<br/>Ruth Kinna, Loughboro University<br/>Ann Larabee, Michigan State University<br/>Martha Lee†, University of Windsor<br/>Michael Loadenthal, Miami University<br/>Jean-François Mayer, Religioscope Institute<br/>Mick (Michael) Smith, Queens University</p></div></div></div><div><div>Contact Email: </div><div><div><a href="mailto:%20jsrmsu@gmail.com"> jsrmsu@gmail.com</a></div></div></div><div><div>URL: </div><div><div><a href="https://msupress.org/journals/journal-for-the-study-of-radicalism/" target="_blank">https://msupress.org/journals/journal-for-the-study-of-radicalism/</a></div></div></div></description>

			<title>Music of the Spheres in Akbarian Sufism. Monday Majlis Online on Monday the 20th of March, 17:00-18:30 (UK time), with Dunja Rašić</title>

Ibn Arabī, however, claimed to have heard this music each time he prayed. My presentation examines how the Pythagorean concept of the music of the spheres has been interpreted and reinterpreted in Akbarian Sufism - with a special emphasis on Ibn Arabī’s notion of <i>samāʿ</i> and the modes of recreating the music of the spheres in Sufi gatherings.</p><p><b>Bio</b></p><p>Dunja Rašić earned her Ph.D in Islamic Studies at the Free University Berlin. Her primary research field is medieval intellectual history, with a focus on Akbarian cosmology, philosophical Sufism and the Islamic philosophy of language. She is currently working on her second book, which is focusing on jinn doubles and the problem of evil in Akbarian Sufism.</p><p>In the spirit of the label ‘Majlis’ and also to make the talks even more interesting, we are experimenting with a new format presenting the topic discussed by our speaker as embedded in their own research journey.

It is a truism: relics, shrines, and various ampullae suture communities together across time and space. This paper is about a set of objects that, in addition to fostering human relationships, have also worked to sever them. It focuses on a cluster of shrines and chapels at Catholic institutions for people with cognitive disabilities in the mid-twentieth century U.S. and analyzes these objects as previously unexplored technologies of institutionalization. It asks how these media worked to justify the social segregation of disabled persons while simultaneously spurring what the anthropologists Faye Ginsburg and Rayna Rapp have dubbed “new kinship imaginaries” (Rapp and Ginsburg 2011) in the postwar era.</p><p>This event is free, but all participants must register in advance and space is limited.

<p>Due to the great interest in the Depicting the Afterlife edited collection, we have arranged to co-edit a special issue of The Australasian Journal of Popular Culture set for publication in early 2024.</p>
<p>The theme remains the same:</p>
<p>As Garrett (2015) contends, popular cultural representations of the afterlife are a means of imaginatively and creatively grappling with the unknown. These representations can offer explanations about life after death or the in-between, to rationalize the existential, support and challenge religious doctrines, and entertain and educate so that society might live life to the fullest or feel assured that there is something more. </p>
<p>According to O’Neil (2022), at their crux, these representations hinge on hope and the prospect of happiness, permeable boundaries that see a blurring of ‘here’ and ‘there,’ self-determination as key to understanding the afterlife, and acts of sacrifice and love that forge the conditions of eternal happiness. These ideas about the afterlife construct perceptions of morality and religion: what one must do now to reap the benefits once one has passed over.</p>
<p>These popular cultural representations, then, present “a range of narratives, consumer choices, moral dispositions and selected rituals of conduct” (Saenz, 1992, p. 43), which people “may adopt, adapt, criticize or reject as components in our implicit knowledge” (Dant, 2012, p. 24). With media such as <em>The Good Place, Upload, The Inbetween, Afterlife of the Party, Coco, Soul, Reaper, Elsewhere, If I Stay, and Boo Bitch </em>(to name but a few), focused on the afterlife, it seems timely to explore the messages promulgated in such texts about morality and/or religion. This is especially given media can prompt questioning and reasoning that aids self-reflection (Hawkins, 2001) and integrates people into an established order offering models of appropriate ways of being (Krijen &amp; Verboord, 2016).</p>
<p>Therefore, this special issue aims to explore representations of morality and/or religion in 21st-century popular cultural texts that feature and emphasize the afterlife. It asks how the afterlife is understood but moreover, how are people encouraged to live their lives? Such aims will inevitably consider what place (if any) religion has in shaping popular cultural texts and understandings of the beyond, and what perceptions of morality are favoured and guide character story arcs. Ultimately this special issue will contribute to a continued and growing discussion on the representations of morality, religion, and the afterlife in contemporary society.</p>
<p>Possible topics might include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moral motivation/reasoning and life after death</li>
<li>Dichotomies of Heaven and Hell</li>
<li>Representations of the ‘soul’</li>
<li>Cultural differences in constructions of the afterlife</li>
<li>Depictions/constructions of the spiritual realm</li>
<li>Ghosts, the paranormal, and the afterlife</li>
<li>Religious motifs in texts that feature the afterlife</li>
<li>Representations of Supreme Being(s)</li>
<li>Notions of suffering and reward in the afterlife</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Full articles are required by 13th October 2023 and are to be emailed to me or my co-editor (Justin Matthews) directly</strong>. Articles should be 5-6k words in length. More information about the AJPC in general can be found here:   </p>

<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">The William James Society and its peer-reviewed journal William James Studies invite article submissions from scholars with diverse interests and approaches to the life and work of William James. We are particularly interested in articles that reflect William James’s work (psychology, philosophy, metaphysics, etc.) as it intersects with modern concerns and interpretive contexts. The William James Society is a multidisciplinary professional society that supports the study of, and communication about, the life and work of James and his ongoing influence in the many fields to which he contributed. William James Studies can be found on several subscription databases, including the Modern Language Association.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We welcome submissions that examine James and pragmatism’s relationship to current issues in contemporary society, especially those with interdisciplinary perspectives with possible orientations toward history, politics, economics, American studies, or religious studies. Papers might examine any number of the following:</p>
<p dir="ltr">* James and the theory and practice of literary interpretation</p>
<p dir="ltr">* James and his relationship to modernism, realism, and other literary genres</p>
<p dir="ltr">* James and nineteenth and/or early twentieth-century aesthetic movements</p>
<p dir="ltr">* James's philosophies of psychology, pragmatism, religion, and literary authors/texts</p>
<p dir="ltr">* James and contemporary interpretive contexts, including critical race theory, feminism, queer theories, ecocriticism, religious studies, game studies, and archival approaches </p>
<p dir="ltr">For consideration for the fall 2023 issue, please submit articles with abstracts by June 1, 2023. </p>
<p dir="ltr">To submit, please review the WJS submissions guidelines here: (<a href="https://williamjamesstudies.org/submission-information/">https://williamjamesstudies.org/submission-information/</a>). </p>
<p dir="ltr">Submissions should outline a clear argument, identify relevant texts by James and others, and place their paper within a contemporary scholarly framework or conversation. All submissions will conform to a strict timetable for publication for the fall 2023 issue of William James Studies.  Please submit direct queries or questions to General Editor Shawn Welch at: (<a href="mailto:shawn.welch101@gmail.com">shawn.welch101@gmail.com</a>) or <a href="mailto:editor@williamjamesstudies.org">editor@williamjamesstudies.org</a>.</p>
